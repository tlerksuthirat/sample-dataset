PFAS may impact the developing epigenome, but current human evidence is limited to assessments of total DNA methylation. We assessed associations between first trimester PFAS exposures with newborn DNA methylation, including 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). DNA methylation mediation of associations between PFAS and birth outcomes were explored in the Michigan Mother Infant Pairs cohort. Nine PFAS were measured in maternal first trimester blood. Seven were highly detected and included for analysis: PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and MeFOSAA. Bisulfite-converted cord blood DNA (n = 141) and oxidative-bisulfite-converted cord blood (n = 70) were assayed on Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChips to measure total DNA methylation (5-mC + 5-hmC) and 5-mC/5-hmC. Correcting for multiple comparisons, beta regressions were used to assess associations between levels of PFAS and total methylation, 5-mC, or 5-hmC. Nonlinear mediation analyses were used to assess the epigenetic meditation effect between PFAS and birth outcomes. Results: PFAS was significantly associated with total methylation (q < 0.05: PFHxS—12 sites; PFOS—19 sites; PFOA—2 sites; PFNA—3 sites; PFDA—4 sites). In 72 female infants and 69 male infants, there were sex-specific associations between five PFAS and DNA methylation. 5-mC and 5-hmC were each significantly associated with thousands of sites for PFHxS, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and MeFOSAA (q < 0.05). Clusters of 5-mC and 5-hmC sites were significant mediators between PFNA and PFUnDA and decreased gestational age (q < 0.05). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the mediation role of specific types of DNA methylation on the relationship between PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. These results suggest that 5-mC and 5-hmC may be more sensitive to the developmental impacts of PFAS than total DNA methylation. © 2023, The Author(s).","Children’s health; Developmental origins of health and disease; DNA methylation; Epigenomics; Hydroxymethylation; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances; Prenatal exposures; Preterm birth","fluorocarbon; hydrogen sulfite; perfluoroundecanoic acid; DNA methylation; female; human; infant; male; Michigan; mother; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; DNA Methylation; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Michigan; Mothers; Pregnancy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85150965292

Sleep and cardiovascular connection represent a two-way lane. Recently, many reports have suggested that meditation practices have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular diseases. But the exact mechanism was not known. Several reports suggest that meditation induces the secretion of melatonin. The rhythm of melatonin follows a sleep pattern. Thus, the present hypothesis correlates the plausible mechanisms involved in meditation with enhancing cardiac health through melatonin synthesis. An altered modern lifestyle decreases the level of melatonin which disrupts the circadian rhythm, and subsequently, there is a high incidence of cardiovascular diseases. The disrupted cardiac energy metabolism is distorted due to altered circadian rhythm with elevated ROS. The increased level of ROS activates the inflammatory mediators' cytokines and damages the DNA, resulting in altered cardiac physiology. Melatonin regulates the circadian rhythm and acts as a silent regulator for the cardiac energy balance. Melatonin is the central player of circadian rhythm, and it protects cardiomyocytes by acting as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory mediator, and repairing DNA damage. Meditation induces melatonin and improves cardiac health through the aforementioned mechanisms. © 2022 by the authors.","cardiovascular diseases; circadian rhythm; DNA repair; Glucose; lipid metabolism; meditation; melatonin; ROS",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127665246

Even so, breathing is enriched with multifunctionality. External signals constantly change breathing, stopping it when under water or deepening it during exertion. Internal cues utilize breath to express emotions such as sighs of frustration and yawns of boredom. Breathing harmonizes with other actions that use our mouth and throat, including speech, chewing, and swallowing. In addition, our perception of breathing intensity can dictate how we feel, such as during the slow breathing of calming meditation and anxiety-inducing hyperventilation. Heartbeat originates from a peripheral pacemaker in the heart, but the automation of breathing arises from neural clusters within the brainstem, enabling interaction with other brain areas and thus multifunctionality. Here, we document how the recent transformation of cellular and molecular tools has contributed to our appreciation of the diversity of neuronal types in the breathing control circuit and how they confer the multifunctionality of breathing.

The findings of our study show that both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations have a significant influence on intention to learn with MOOCs. In addition, the results also suggest that the relationship between extrinsic motivation and intention to learn is mediated by the technology fit perceived by learners but not the relationship between intrinsic motivation and intention to learn. Furthermore, the relationships between both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and intention to learn are moderated by subjective norms. This study enriches the extant literature on the impact of technology fit and subjective norms on MOOC learning. Few studies have focused on how students can be effectively encouraged to take MOOCs.

It is known that when people sit with closed eyes instead of open eyes, they have different brain dynamics, which may be associated with a combination of deprived sensory input and more relaxed inner psychophysiological and cognitive states. Here, we study such states based on a previously established experimental methodology, with the aid of an electro-encephalography (EEG) array with 128 electrodes. We derived the Shannon Entropy (H) and Pearson’s 1st Skewness Coefficient (PSk) from the power spectrum for the modalities of meditation and video watching, including 20 participants, 11 meditators and 9 non-meditators. The discriminating performance of the indices H and PSk was evaluated using Student’s t-test. The results demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the mean H and PSk values during meditation and video watch modes. We show that the H index is useful to discriminate between Meditator and Non-Meditator participants during meditation over both the prefrontal and occipital areas, while the PSk index is useful to discriminate Meditators from Non-Meditators based on the prefrontal areas for both meditation and video modes. Moreover, we observe episodes of anti-correlation between the prefrontal and occipital areas during meditation, while there is no evidence for such anticorrelation periods during video watching.

It is shown that the root mean square of successive differences preferentially weights higher frequency Fourier modes, making it unsuitable as a biosignal for mindful breathing meditation which encourages slow breathing. We propose a new metric called the autonomic balance index (ABI) which uses Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia to quantify the fraction of heart rate variability contributed by the parasympathetic nervous system.

Here, we report a remote, randomized, controlled study (NCT05304000) of three different daily 5-min breathwork exercises compared with an equivalent period of mindfulness meditation over 1 month. The breathing conditions are (1) cyclic sighing, which emphasizes prolonged exhalations; (2) box breathing, which is equal duration of inhalations, breath retentions, and exhalations; and (3) cyclic hyperventilation with retention, with longer inhalations and shorter exhalations. The primary endpoints are improvement in mood and anxiety as well as reduced physiological arousal (respiratory rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability). Using a mixed-effects model, we show that breathwork, especially the exhale-focused cyclic sighing, produces greater improvement in mood (p < 0.05) and reduction in respiratory rate (p < 0.05) compared with mindfulness meditation. Daily 5-min cyclic sighing has promise as an effective stress management exercise. © 2022 The Authors","anxiety; autonomic; breathwork; heart rate variability; limbic; mindfulness meditation; mood; physiology; sleep; stress; wearable","adult; anxiety; arousal; Article; box breathing; breath retention; breathing exercise; breathing rate; breathing reflex; breathwork; comparative study; controlled study; cyclic hyperventilation; cyclic retention; cyclic sighing; exhalation; female; heart rate variability; human; inhalation; male; mindfulness meditation; mood; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; stress management; therapy effect; young adult; affect; arousal; breathing; meditation; therapy; Affect; Anxiety; Arousal; Humans; Meditation; Respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146262473

Accordingly, there is a critical need to develop novel interventions, particularly ones that target neural mechanisms believed to potentiate depressive symptoms. Directly addressing this gap, we developed mindfulness-based fMRI neurofeedback (mbNF) for adolescents that aims to reduce default mode network (DMN) hyperconnectivity, which has been implicated in the onset and maintenance of MDD. In this proof-of-concept study, adolescents (n = 9) with a lifetime history of depression and/or anxiety were administered clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, and each participant’s DMN and central executive network (CEN) were personalized using a resting state fMRI localizer. After the localizer scan, adolescents completed a brief mindfulness training followed by a mbNF session in the scanner wherein they were instructed to volitionally reduce DMN relative to CEN activation by practicing mindfulness meditation. Several promising findings emerged. First, mbNF successfully engaged the target brain state during neurofeedback; participants spent more time in the target state with DMN activation lower than CEN activation. Second, in each of the nine adolescents, mbNF led to significantly reduced within-DMN connectivity, which correlated with post-mbNF increases in state mindfulness. Last, a reduction of within-DMN connectivity mediated the association between better mbNF performance and increased state mindfulness. These findings demonstrate that personalized mbNF can effectively and non-invasively modulate the intrinsic networks associated with the emergence and persistence of depressive symptoms during adolescence. © 2023, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85151285237

Tangible changes to the external surroundings may be practical causes for epigenetic modifications, playing a potential evolutionary role. While fight, flight, or freeze responses once served a concrete role in survival, modern humans may not face similar existential threats that warrant psychological stress. Yet, chronic mental stress is predominant in modern life. This chapter elucidates the deleterious epigenetic changes that occur due to chronic stress. In an exploration of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) as a potential antidote to such stress-induced epigenetic modifications, several pathways of action are uncovered. The epigenetic changes that occur because of mindfulness practice are demonstrated across the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, serotonergic transmission, genomic health and aging, and neurological biomarkers. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Chronic stress; Epigenetic age; Epigenetics; Meditation; Mindfulness; Stress; Subtelomere; Telomere","genetic epigenesis; genomics; human; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; mindfulness; Epigenesis, Genetic; Genomics; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Mindfulness; Pituitary-Adrenal System",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149217588

For example, stressful conditions created by adverse early-life events, unhealthy habits and low socio-economic status may favor the onset of diseases linked to neuroendocrine dysregulation, inflammation and neuroinflammation. Beside pharmacological treatments used in clinical settings, much attention has been given to complementary treatments such as mind-body techniques involving meditation that rely on the activation of inner resources to regain health. At the molecular level, the effects of both stress and meditation are elicited epigenetically through a set of mechanisms that regulate gene expression as well as the circulating neuroendocrine and immune effectors. Epigenetic mechanisms constantly reshape genome activities in response to external stimuli, representing a molecular interface between organism and environment. In the present work, we aimed to review the current knowledge on the correlation between epigenetics, gene expression, stress and its possible antidote, meditation. After introducing the relationship between brain, physiology, and epigenetics, we will proceed to describe three basic epigenetic mechanisms: chromatin covalent modifications, DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. Subsequently, we will give an overview of the physiological and molecular aspects related to stress. Finally, we will address the epigenetic effects of meditation on gene expression. The results of the studies reported in this review demonstrate that mindful practices modulate the epigenetic landscape, leading to increased resilience. Therefore, these practices can be considered valuable tools that complement pharmacological treatments when coping with pathologies related to stress. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","DNA methylation; Epigenetic clock; Epigenetics; Meditation; Mindfulness; Resilience; Stress; Well-being","brain; genetic epigenesis; human; hypothalamus hypophysis system; inflammation; meditation; Brain; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Inflammation; Meditation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148702462

But in The Sacred Depths of Nature, eminent biologist Ursula Goodenough shows us that the scientific world view need not be a source of despair. Indeed, it can be a wellspring of solace and hope. This eloquent volume reconciles the modern scientific understanding of reality with our timeless spiritual yearnings for reverence and continuity. Looking at topics such as evolution, emotions, sexuality, and death, Goodenough writes with rich, uncluttered detail about the workings of nature in general and of living creatures in particular. Her luminous clarity makes it possible for even non-scientists to appreciate that the origins of life and the universe are no less meaningful because of our increasingly scientific understanding of them. At the end of each chapter, Goodenough's spiritual reflections respond to the complexity of nature with vibrant emotional intensity and a sense of reverent wonder. This new edition offers a deepened consideration of emergent properties and emergent dynamics, as well as an exploration of their role as the generators of life's complexity. Goodenough also expands upon the ethic of ecomorality in a new chapter, and incorporates new quotes, figures, and poems in her analysis. A beautifully written celebration of molecular biology with meditations on the spiritual and religious meaning that can be found at the heart of science, this volume makes an important contribution to the ongoing dialog between science and religion.

While reasons for and aims of using CAM have been evaluated in many studies, less is known about whether patients’ concepts of how and why cancer develops has an influence on the choice of the CAM method. Methods: We pooled the data from all studies of our working group containing questions on lay etiological concepts and CAM usage and reanalyzed them with respect to the associations between these parameters. Results: The pooled dataset from 12 studies included 4792 patients. A third (1645 patients) reported using CAM. Most often used were supplements (55.9%), relaxation techniques (43.6%), and homeopathy (37.9%). Regarding perceived causes, patients most often marked stress (35.4%) followed by genes (31.9%). While all lay etiological beliefs were highly significantly associated with usage of CAM in general, there was no association between single lay etiological concepts and types of CAM used. Yet, in a network analysis, we found two associations: one comprising trauma, mistletoe, genes, and nutritional supplements, the other yoga, vitamin C, nutritional supplements, and TCM herbs. In the correlation heatmap, one cluster comprises etiological concepts of personality, immune system and trauma, and two clusters of CAM methods emerged: one comprising praying, yoga, meditation, and relaxation procedures, the other nutritional supplements, selenium, vitamins A and C. Conclusion: While physicians are trained to derive treatment strategies from etiological concepts, lay people choosing CAM do not follow these rules, which may point to other needs of patients addressed by CAM. © 2023, The Author(s).","Alternative medicine; Cancer patients; Carcinogenesis; Complementary medicine; Lay etiology; Neoplasm",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85146555005

Hence, this study aimed to assess the effect of Om chanting and Yoga Nidra on depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality and autonomic functions on individuals with hypertension. Methods: This prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in patients with hypertension at Little Flower Medical Research Center. A total of 80 patients with diagnosed hypertension were recruited and randomized equally to either the experimental group or control group. The experimental group received a combination of Om chanting and Yoga Nidra for five days a week for two months. The control group participants continued with their regular conventional medications. Depression anxiety stress scale (DASS), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and heart rate variability (HRV) scores were assessed at baseline, 30 and 60 day for both the groups. Results: A total of 34 subjects in the experimental group and 31 subjects in the control group were included in the analysis. There was a significant (p<0.001) reduction in depression, anxiety, stress, and a significant (p<0.001) improvement in PSQI and HRV parameters in the experimental group was observed as compared to the control group. No adverse events were reported during the trial period. Conclusions: The current study validates the effectiveness of Om chanting and Yoga Nidra in reducing depression, anxiety, stress and improving sleep quality and autonomic functions in hypertensive patients. These interventions could thus be considered a safer form of complementary therapy in managing stress and hypertension. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","HRV; meditation; Om chanting; stress; yoga; yoga nidra","adult; anxiety; Article; body mass; controlled study; depression; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; electrocardiography; female; follow up; groups by age; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; physician; physiological stress; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prospective study; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; sleep disorder; sleep efficiency; sleep quality; statistical model; yoga nidra; anxiety; depression; sleep quality; yoga; Anxiety; Depression; Humans; Prospective Studies; Sleep Quality; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132224971

Previous studies provided evidence that communication between pediatric oncologists (POs) and patients/families about the use of these therapies is often incomplete. Furthermore, nationwide studies on this topic are rare. Aims: We assessed POs' perspectives on the use of complementary medicine (CM) in Switzerland, on the basis of an edited survey previously used in a nationwide study. Methods and Results: A link to an online survey was sent by e-mail to each of the fifty-two eligible pediatric oncologists in all nine Swiss Pediatric Oncology Group (SPOG) centers. Eligible respondents were board-certified (Switzerland or abroad) POs currently working at a SPOG center. The survey was available for a total period of 2 months. We received 29 filled questionnaires (overall response rate: 56%). Most POs (59%) indicated that they ask more than 50% of their patients about CM use. Frequent reasons for not asking about the use of CM were i) forgetting to ask (55%), ii) lack of knowledge on the subject (31%), and iii) lack of time (24%). More than every second PO (55%) reported having a lack of knowledge on the subject. A majority of POs (66% to 76%) indicated interest in learning more about specific CM topics (cannabinoids, hypnosis and relaxation, music therapy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, meditation, and yoga). More information and specific training opportunities on the use of CM was deemed important by 76% to 97% of POs. Conclusion: POs working in Switzerland identify complementary therapies as an important subject. Swiss POs are willing to acquire more knowledge on CM. More training seems to be necessary in order to increase awareness about the topic, to enhance communication about complementary therapies and thus to improve patient care. © 2022 The Authors.

Integrating MPs into world mainstream medicine (WMM) requires effective empirical investigation of psychophysiological impacts. Epigenomic regulation is a probable mechanism of action that is empirically assessable. Recently, WMM-styled studies have screened the epigenomic impacts of MPs with early encouraging results. This article discusses the variety of MPs extant across three major Eastern religio-spiritual-healing traditions and their integration into WMM via the lens of epigenomic modulation. MPs unanimously report positive impacts on stress-reduction pathways, known to be epigenomically sensitive. Early high-resolution assays show MPs are potent in altering the epigenome - dynamically and by inducing long-term changes. This suggests the importance of integrating MPs into WMM.","dhikr; epigenetic; heartfulness; MBSR; meditation; mindfulness; qigong; Quran recitation; tai-chi; yoga; Zen-vipassana","epigenetics; human; meditation; procedures; Epigenomics; Humans; Meditation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85150751795

Therefore, we conducted a survey regarding the association between CAM, self-efficacy, and patient activation in adult cancer patients. A standardized questionnaire, consisted of the ASKU, the PAM 13-D, and a structured questionnaire on CAM usage from our own working group, was distributed to 880 potential participants. Six hundred and thirty-nine (639) patients (male 32.9%, female 63.2%; gynecological cancer 41%, gastrointestinal 19.2%, urogenital 15.6%) took part. 60% of all patients used CAM in the last 3 months (biological 73%, holistic 63%, mind–body methods 62%). Higher self-efficacy was associated with higher interest in CAM (p = 0.03), but not usage of CAM, compared to patients with lower self-efficacy (p = 0.099). Higher patient activation was associated with higher interest in CAM (p = 0.004) and usage of CAM (p = 0.012). Patients with higher activation significantly more often used homeopathy (p = 0.007), prayer (p = 0.002), yoga, etc. (p = 0.032), meditation (p = 0.002), low carb or ketogenic diets (p < 0.001) (but not vegan or other cancer diets). Higher patient activation is associated with higher usage of CAM. Focusing on patient activation as a goal in patient–physician relationship will help patients to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and to actively participate in the whole treatment process. © 2022, The Author(s).","Communication; Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); Neoplasm; Patient activation; Patient–physician relationship; Self-efficacy","adult; aged; alternative medicine; Article; brain cancer; breast cancer; cancer patient; controlled study; doctor patient relationship; female; female genital tract cancer; gastrointestinal cancer; head and neck cancer; health care utilization; health survey; healthy lifestyle; hematologic malignancy; homeopathy; human; ketogenic diet; low carbohydrate diet; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; meditation; patient activation; patient attitude; pilot study; religion; self concept; skin cancer; structured questionnaire; thyroid cancer; urogenital tract cancer; very elderly; yoga; neoplasm; patient participation; questionnaire; self concept; Adult; Complementary Therapies; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasms; Patient Participation; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137452355

Organ systems inside human body interact mutually in the manner of swapping the active-passive role, according to Yin-Yang theory in traditional Chinese medicine. Yang as an active source rules over Yin as a passive load. Nonlinear inter-driven (NLID) factor, F(Y/X), based on recurrence analysis is proposed in this study. NLID factor characterizes the nonlinear interactions between two nonlinear dynamical systems, cardiac and respiratory systems. NLID factor is computed by quantifying the HR and RP recurrent plots constructed from phase trajectories based on embedding theorem and phase-space reconstruction. Heterogeneous patterns of HR and RP recurrence plots in continuous-attention task reflect highly unpredictable system dynamics. Heterogeneous HR recurrence patterns are surprisingly associated with the nearly homogeneous RP recurrence plot at resting state, indicating rather weak cardiorespiratory interaction. HR recurrence in Zen exhibits notable regularity in spite of the irregular RP recurrence behaviors. NLID factor reveals prominent Yang energy delivered by RP system that dominates over the cardiac system in Zen-meditation group. Such findings draw our attention to the possibly extraordinary self-regularity power of heart (and autonomic nervous system) in the Zen-meditation state. © 2022 National Taiwan University.","Active-passive role; Cardiorespiratory interaction; Heart-rate sequence; Nonlinear dynamics; Recurrence analysis","Dynamical systems; Heart; Respiratory system; Active/passive; Active–passive role; Cardiorespiratory interaction; Dynamical theory; Heart-rate; Heart-rate sequence; Nonlinear dynamical interactions; Recurrence analysis; Recurrence plot; Yin yangs; Nonlinear dynamical systems; article; attention; autonomic nervous system; Chinese medicine; controlled study; embedding; heart rate; human; meditation; nonlinear system; organ systems; respiratory system; yin-yang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133918891

This research has demonstrated that non-conscious dynamics tend to be more synchronous than in conscious states, which are more asynchronous. Here we go beyond this dichotomy to demonstrate that different brain states are underpinned by dissociable spatiotemporal dynamics. We investigated human neuroimaging data from different brain states (resting state, meditation, deep sleep and disorders of consciousness after coma). The model-free approach was based on Kuramoto’s turbulence framework using coupled oscillators. This was extended by a measure of the information cascade across spatial scales. Complementarily, the model-based approach used exhaustive in silico perturbations of whole-brain models fitted to these measures. This allowed studying of the information encoding capabilities in given brain states. Overall, this framework demonstrates that elements from turbulence theory provide excellent tools for describing and differentiating between brain states. © 2022, The Author(s).",,"brain; consciousness; diagnostic imaging; human; Brain; Consciousness; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133132076

Previous work has shown that heightened dispositional mindfulness is associated with the awareness of the importance of exercise, exercise self-efficacy, exercise motivation, and self-reported exercise level. However, more methodologically rigorous studies are needed to understand the relationship between mindfulness and the psychological mechanisms related to exercise motivation, including the identification of why individuals are motivated to engage in exercise, the subjective experience of exercise, and the propensity for exercise dependence and addiction. In this cross-sectional investigation, we utilized the framework of the Self-Determination Theory to examine the hypothesis that heightened dispositional mindfulness (as measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) would be associated with increased levels of exercise motivation that were derived by higher levels of autonomous self-regulation. Individuals were recruited from urban areas who self-reported either low (exercising 2 or fewer times per week for 20 min or less; n = 78) or moderate (exercising 1 or 2 times per week for 20 min or more; n = 127) levels of exercise engagement. As hypothesized, heightened dispositional mindfulness was significantly associated with heightened levels of exercise self-determination as measured by the Behavioral Regulations in Exercise Questionnaire, with this effect being driven by negative associations with amotivation, external regulation, and introjected regulation. Additionally, we found that heightened dispositional mindfulness was associated with lower levels of psychological distress upon exercise and decreased exercise dependence/addiction. Overall, increased dispositional mindfulness may support a healthy relationship with exercise. These findings have implications for the utility of mindfulness interventions to support the regulation of exercise behaviors in service of enhancing exercise motivation and engagement.

Patient demographics, cancer characteristics, treatments, reasons for seeking and timing of IO consultation, and IO treatment modalities were analyzed. The IO program treated 64 young women with a median age of 38.6 years. Clinical staging was primarily IA (27%), IIA (34%), or IIB (27%), and 64% of patients were clinically node negative with no evidence of metastasis. Women utilized the IO program for recurrence risk reduction and for treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs), most commonly vasomotor complaints (44%). Therapies utilized were acupuncture (36%), healing touch (28%), oncology massage (30%), and other (75%; music therapy, therapeutic art, spiritual care, meditation, t'ai chi, yoga, and nutrition), which were commonly initiated during treatment (69%). Our data suggest that young women utilize IO services to reduce their future cancer risk and TRAEs, but they are often referred after standard cancer care treatments have begun.

Stress is an established risk factor in SUD’s development of addiction and in reinstating drug seeking. Despite this expanding epidemic and the potential for its grave consequences, there are limited options available for management and treatment, as well as pharmacotherapies and psychosocial treatments. To this end, there is a need for new and improved devices dedicated to the detection, management, and treatment of SUD. In this paper, the negative effects of SUD-related stress were discussed, and based on that, a few significant biomarkers were selected from a set of eight features collected by a chest-worn device, RespiBAN Professional, on fifteen individuals. We used three machine learning classifiers on these optimal biomarkers to detect stress. Based on the accuracies, the best biomarkers to detect stress and those considered as features for classification were determined to be electrodermal activity (EDA), body temperature, and a chest-worn accelerometer. Additionally, the differences between mental stress and physical stress, as well as different administrations of meditation during the study, were identified and analysed.

It is likely that there is an intergenerational transmission of risk from mother to child; however, the mechanisms through which such risk is conferred remain unknown. The current study evaluated the association between maternal ACEs, neonatal brain development of the amygdala and hippocampus, and later infant negative emotionality at six months of age. Methods: The sample included 85 mother-infant dyads (44 female infants) from a longitudinal study. Maternal ACEs were assessed with the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire (ACE-Q) and neonatal hippocampal and amygdala volume was assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Infant negative emotionality was assessed at 6 months using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ). Results: Multivariate analyses demonstrated that maternal ACEs were associated with bilateral amygdala volume (F(2,78) = 3.697,p =.029). Specifically, higher maternal ACEs were associated with smaller left (β = -0.220, t(79) = -2.661, p =.009, R2= 0.494, and right (β = −0.167, t(79) = -2.043, p =.044, R2= 0.501) amygdala volume. No significant association between maternal ACEs and bilateral hippocampal volume (F(2,78) = 0.215,p =.0807) was found. Follow-up regression analyses demonstrated that both high maternal ACEs and smaller left amygdala volume were associated with higher infant negative emotionality at six months of age (β =.232, p =.040, R2= 0.094, and β = −0.337, p =.022, R2= 0.16, respectively) although statistically significant mediation of this effect was not observed (Indirect effect = 0.0187, 95% CI [-0.0016-0.0557]). Conclusions: Maternal ACEs are associated with both newborn amygdala volume and subsequent infant negative emotionality. These findings linking maternal adverse childhood experiences and infant brain development and temperament provide evidence to support the intergenerational transmission of adversity from mother to child. © 2022 The Authors","Amygdala; Gray matter volume; Hippocampus; Intergenerational transmission; Maternal adverse childhood experiences; Negative emotionality","cannabis; illicit drug; psychotropic agent; adult; Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire; amygdala; anemia; Apgar score; Article; artificial ventilation; brain development; brain size; childhood adversity; chromosome aberration; clinical article; cognitive behavioral therapy; emotionality; ethnicity; female; follow up; gestational age; household income; human; hypertension; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; infant behavior questionnaire; interview; longitudinal study; marriage; maternal age; meditation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; placenta previa; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; psychosis; quality control; questionnaire; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomics; vagina bleeding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138759888

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and third-wave CBT hold promise as treatments for diabetes-related distress, although previous findings are inconclusive. We aimed to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to understand the efficacy of these interventions in treating diabetes-related distress, while also assessing the associative benefits of these interventions on depression, anxiety and glycaemic control. We also aimed to conduct a narrative synthesis, and subgroup analyses to identify intervention components most useful in treating diabetes-related distress. Method: We searched seven electronic databases from inception to April 2021. Data extraction was independently performed by two reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed. The protocol was registered with the Prospective Register Of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42021240628. Results: We included 22 randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of CBT and third-wave CBT interventions on diabetes-related distress. CBT for diabetes-related distress significantly reduced distress (SMD = −0.278, p = 0.010) and depression (SMD = −0.604, p = 0.016). Third-wave CBT for diabetes-related distress significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = −0.451, p = 0.034). No significant effect of either intervention on glycated haemoglobin was observed. CBT interventions that included a digital component, were delivered by a psychological practitioner, and included behavioural activation bolstered the effects on diabetes-related distress. Conclusions: CBT aiming to target diabetes-related distress is beneficial for distress and depression. Third-wave CBT for diabetes-related distress is beneficial for anxiety. More work is needed to optimise interventions to improve both mental and physical health outcomes in people with diabetes. © 2022 The Authors.

It is not known if other factors might contribute to exceptional responses or outcomes. We explored aspects of the medical history, lifestyle changes, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use and communication between health care practitioners and patients who experienced an exceptional response following cancer treatment. Methods: All subjects whose case was submitted to the ERI were eligible to participate in the survey. A 121-question survey questionnaire was developed to assess aspects of the subject's past medical history, lifestyle (e.g., diet, exercise, spirituality) and use of CAM. Results: Thirty subjects completed and returned the questionnaire from approximately 88 patients invited to participate (approximate response rate = 34%). Approximately 68% were female and 32% were male. Fifty percent of subjects changed their diet after their cancer diagnosis. Eighteen patients (60%) reported using a CAM therapy (not including oral vitamins/minerals or spiritual practices) during their Exceptional Response (ER). Conclusion: Multiple factors, including features of the tumor itself, the patient, or the environment, could affect tumor response or patient survival, either solely or in combination with the treatments received. Many patients use other medications, change their diet or physical activity or use CAM interventions after their cancer diagnosis. Investigators attempting to understand the exceptional response phenomenon should acquire rich data sets of their subjects that include information about these factors. © 2022","Complementary Alternative Medicine; Diet, Physical Activity; Exceptional response; Lifestyle","ascorbic acid; curcumin; melatonin; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; adult; aged; alternative medicine; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer survival; cancer therapy; clinical article; diet; exceptional response; exercise; female; gastroesophageal reflux; health care personnel; health program; health survey; human; hypertension; hypothyroidism; leisure; lifestyle modification; male; malignant neoplasm; medical history; meditation; melanoma; mesothelioma; National Cancer Institute’s Exceptional Responders Initiative; national health organization; naturopathy; overall survival; perception; physical activity; quality of life; questionnaire; treatment response; very elderly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135885313

While promising, pain self-management (PSM) interventions have not been tailored to this population’s needs. Aims: To design a PSM intervention for patients with cirrhosis. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 17 patients with cirrhosis, 12 hepatologists, and 6 administrators from two medical centers were conducted to inform a rigorous, structured intervention mapping (IM) process. Qualitative content analysis was guided by social cognitive theory (SCT) and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and incorporated into intervention development. A planning group met regularly throughout the intervention, to reach consensus about how to use data and theory to develop the intervention through IM. Results: Participants described barriers to PSM behaviors, including the absence of simple, evidence-based interventions for pain for patients with cirrhosis, inadequate provider knowledge, time, and training, and lack of champions, funding, and communication. Patients described high motivation to treat pain using behavioral methods including meditation, prayer, and exercise. The intervention was designed to address barriers to PSM behaviors for patients with cirrhosis, using behavior change methods that address knowledge, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations. The LEAP (Liver Education About Pain) intervention is a 12-week, modular intervention delivered by phone via individual and group sessions with a health coach. Conclusions: People with cirrhosis, hepatologists, and administrators informed this theory-driven, tailored PSM intervention, which was designed to be implementable in the real world. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Addiction; Chronic pain; Intervention mapping; Liver disease; Opioid","opiate; aged; analgesia; Article; behavior change; chronic pain; clinical article; content analysis; controlled study; exercise; female; health; human; implementation science; knowledge; leisure; liver cirrhosis; male; meditation; motivation; outcome assessment; religion; self care; self concept; semi structured interview; Social Cognitive Theory; analgesia; chronic pain; complication; health care personnel; liver cirrhosis; procedures; Chronic Pain; Health Personnel; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Pain Management; Self-Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124599471

To assess the clinical efficacy of TCE in the treatment of CLBP, we performed a systematic review of existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of CLBP and summarized the neural mechanisms underlying TCE in the treatment of CLBP. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in four electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and EBSCO from January 1991 to March 2022. The quality of all included RCTs was evaluated by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale (PEDro). The primary outcomes included pain severity and pain-related disability. Results: A total of 11 RCTs with 1,256 middle-aged and elderly patients with CLBP were included. The quality of all 11 included RCTs ranged from moderate to high according to PEDro. Results suggested that TCE could considerably reduce pain intensity in patients with CLBP. Overall, most studies did not find any difference in secondary outcomes (quality of life, depression, and sleep quality). Conclusion: The neurophysiological mechanism of TCE for treating CLBP could be linked to meditation and breathing, posture control, strength and flexibility training, and regulation of pain-related brain networks. Our systematic review showed that TCE appears to be effective in alleviating pain in patients with CLBP.

Input was obtained at both the individual user and clinic levels (ie, patients with and survivors of cancer and health care providers). Objective: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of a cancer-specific meditation app prototype. Methods: Patients with and survivors of cancer who were recruited and enrolled in the feasibility randomized controlled trial were asked to use the prototype app daily (≥70 minutes per week) for 4 weeks. Participants completed web-based weekly questionnaires and a final poststudy questionnaire and were asked to participate in an optional web-based poststudy interview. The questionnaires and interviews covered the following feasibility categories: acceptability, demand, practicality, and adaptation. Results: A total of 36 patients with and survivors of cancer completed the baseline questionnaire, 18 completed the final questionnaire, and 6 completed the optional interviews. Weekly and poststudy questionnaires indicated high overall enjoyment, ease of use, and satisfaction with the app content, aesthetics, and graphics. The objective use data indicated that the average total app use rate was 73.39 (SD 7.12) minutes per week. Interviews (N=6) revealed positive and mixed responses to the app prototype and informative differences related to preferences for narrators, emotional content, and meditation teaching but an overall appreciation for the variety of options. Conclusions: The most likely candidates for moving from cancer-specific meditation apps to dissemination are through partnering with the industry, in which name recognition and market distribution are already established (even showing a base of users from the targeted population with cancer). This study established the feasibility of a cancer-specific mobile meditation app prototype for patients with and survivors of cancer, using a commercially available app. The quantitative and qualitative data demonstrated the acceptability, demand, practicality, and adaptation of the prototype. Improvements suggested by the participants will be considered in the final app design before testing the efficacy of the app in a future study.

The primary mechanism of action of classic psychedelics is binding to serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors. Agonist activity at these receptors leads to neuromodulatory changes in synaptic efficacy that can have a profound effect on hierarchical message-passing in the brain. Here, we review the cognitive and neuroimaging evidence for the effects of psychedelics: in particular, their influence on selfhood and subject-object boundaries—known as ego dissolution—surmised to underwrite their subjective and therapeutic effects. Agonism of 5-HT2A recep-tors, located at the apex of the cortical hierarchy, may have a particularly powerful effect on sentience and consciousness. These effects can endure well after the pharmacological half-life, suggesting that psychedelics may have effects on neural plasticity that may play a role in their therapeutic efficacy. Psychologi-cally, this may be accompanied by a disarming of ego resistance that increases the repertoire of perceptual hypotheses and affords alternate pathways for thought and behavior, including those that undergird selfhood. We consider the interaction between serotonergic neuromodulation and sentience through the lens of hierarchical predictive coding, which speaks to the value of psychedelics in understanding how we make sense of the world and specific predictions about effective connectivity in cortical hierarchies that can be tested using functional neuroimaging. Significance Statement——Classic psychedelics bind to serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors. Their agonist activity at these receptors leads to neuromodulatory changes in synaptic efficacy, resulting in a profound effect on information processing in the brain. Here, we synthesize an abundance of brain imaging research with pharmacological and psychological interpretations informed by the framework of predictive coding. Moreover, predictive coding is suggested to offer more sophisticated interpretations of neuroimaging find-ings by bridging the role between the 5-HT2A receptors and large-scale brain networks. © 2022 by The Author(s).",,"psychedelic agent; serotonin 2A agonist; serotonin 2A receptor; psychedelic agent; amygdala; Article; consciousness; default mode network; dissolution; ego; functional connectivity; functional neuroimaging; hippocampus; human; medial temporal lobe; meditation; mesencephalon; neuroscience; psychology; resting state network; retrosplenial cortex; treatment outcome; brain; solubility; Brain; Consciousness; Ego; Hallucinogens; Humans; Solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137766757

Strategies such as mindfulness meditation, physical exercise (PE), or computerized cognitive training (CCT) may benefit stroke patients by impacting neuroplasticity and brain health. Materials and methods: One hundred and forty-one chronic stroke patients are randomly allocated to receive mindfulness-based stress reduction + CCT (n = 47), multicomponent PE program + CCT (n = 47), or CCT alone (n = 47). Interventions consist of 12-week home-based programs five days per week. Before and after the interventions, we collect data from cognitive, psychological, and physical tests, blood and stool samples, and structural and functional brain scans. Results: The effects of the interventions on cognitive and emotional outcomes will be described in intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. We will also explore potential mediators and moderators, such as genetic, molecular, brain, demographic, and clinical factors in our per-protocol sample. Discussion: The MindFit Project is a randomized clinical trial that aims to assess the impact of mindfulness and PE combined with CCT on chronic stroke patients’ cognitive and emotional wellbeing. Furthermore, our design takes a multimodal biopsychosocial approach that will generate new knowledge at multiple levels of evidence, from molecular bases to behavioral changes.

In recent years, herbal compounding and active ingredients have been used to control tumor growth, reduce suffering, improve quality of life, and prolong the life span of cancer patients. To reduce side effects, herbal medicine can be used in conjunction with radiotherapy and chemotherapy or can be used as an adjuvant to strengthen the immune effect of anticancer vaccines. In particular, in the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment, herbal medicine can have antitumor effects by stimulating the immune response. This paper reviews the advances in research on antitumor immunomodulation in Chinese herbal medicine, including the regulation of the innate immune system, which includes macrophages, MDSCs, and natural killer cells, and the adaptive immune system, which includes CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), to influence tumor-associated inflammation. In addition, a combination of active ingredients of herbal medicine and modern nanotechnology alter the tumor immune microenvironment. In recent years, immunological antitumor therapy in TCM has been applied on a reasonably large scale both nationally and internationally, and there is potential for further clinical expansion. Investigation of immune modulation mechanisms in Chinese herbal medicine will provide novel perspectives of how herbal medicine controls tumor growth and metastasis, which will contribute to the evolution of tumor research. Methodology: Experimental research between the years of 2012-2022, meta-analysis and reviews for the period 2002-2022 found on the Databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database were used. The inclusion criteria were experimental research literature addressing the anti-tumor immunological effects of active ingredients and nanoparticles in Chinese herbal medicine. Exclusion criteria were articles that addressed Chinese herbal medicine and nano-formulations without discussing anti-tumor immunological effects in innate, adaptive immune cells, MDSCs, and nuclear factors.

Methods: The eligible 136 participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to the experimental group (mindfulness yoga + conventional care) and the control group (conventional care). The hospital anxiety and depression scale was used to assess anxiety and depression symptoms as the primary outcome. Secondary results comprised fatigue (RPFS-CV), pain (BPI-C), and health-related quality of life (FACT-B). Assessments were performed at baseline time, the 8th week, and the 20th week. Results: The Experimental group had a better prognosis in comparison with those in the control group, especially for anxiety [inter-group effect, T1: 1.18 (95% CI 0.20–2.17; P = 0.018)], depression [T1: 1.49 (95% CI 0.48–2.50; P = 0.004)] and health-related life quality [T1: − 6.34 (95% CI − 11.81 to − 0.87; P = 0.023)]. While fatigue [T1: 0.23 (95% CI − 0.24–0.69; P = 0.337); T2: 0.27 (95% CI − 0.16–0.71; P = 0.219)] and pain [T1: 1.11 (95% CI − 0.05–2.27; P = 0.060); T2: 0.68 (95% CI − 0.27–1.62; P = 0.159)] were not different between the two groups. Conclusion: In patients with early-stage breast cancer who had received adjuvant chemotherapy, treatment with mindfulness yoga is as effective as conventional care in improving physical function.

Athletes completed one of two styles of mindfulness meditation (focused-attention or open-monitoring) or a control listening condition prior to performing an implicitly sequenced tennis serve return task involving the goal of hitting a target area placed on the service court. Unbeknownst to athletes, six distinct serves followed a repeating second-order conditional sequence for two task blocks before the sequence was altered in a third transfer block. Task performance was operationalized as serve return outcome and analyzed using beta regression modeling. Models analyzed group by block differences in the proportion of returned serves (i.e., non-aces), returns placed in the service court, and target hits. Contrary to previous laboratory findings, results did not support meditation-related augmentation of performance and/or sequence learning. In fact, compared to control, meditation may have impaired performance improvements and acquisition of serve sequence information. It is possible that the effects of single-session meditation seen in laboratory research may not extend to more complex motor tasks, at least in highly-trained adolescents completing a well-learned skill. Further research is required to elucidate the participant, task, and meditation-related characteristics that might promote single-session meditation performance enhancement.

Modifiable lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise, meditation, and social interaction) have been proposed to benefit memory and brain function. However, previous studies have focused on a single exercise modality or a single lifestyle factor. Consequently, the effect of a more comprehensive exercise program that combines multiple exercise modalities and lifestyle factors, as well as examines potential mediators and moderators, on cognitive function and brain health in late middle-aged and older adults remains understudied. This study's primary aim is to examine the effect of a multi-domain exercise intervention on memory and brain function in cognitively healthy late middle-aged and older adults. In addition, we will examine whether apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotypes, physical fitness (i.e., cardiovascular fitness, body composition, muscular fitness, flexibility, balance, and power), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) moderate and mediate the exercise intervention effects on memory and brain function. Methods: The Western-Eastern Brain Fitness Integration Training (WE-BFit) is a single-blinded, double-arm, 6-month randomized controlled trial. One hundred cognitively healthy adults, aged 45–70 years, with different risks for Alzheimer's disease (i.e., ApoE genotype) will be recruited and randomized into either a multi-domain exercise group or an online educational course control group. The exercise intervention consists of one 90-min on-site and several online sessions up to 60 min per week for 6 months. Working memory, episodic memory, physical fitness, and BDNF will be assessed before and after the 6-month intervention. The effects of the WE-BFit on memory and brain function will be described and analyzed. We will further examine how ApoE genotype and changes in physical fitness and BDNF affect the effects of the intervention. Discussion: WE-BFit is designed to improve memory and brain function using a multi-domain exercise intervention. The results will provide insight into the implementation of an exercise intervention with multiple domains to preserve memory and brain function in adults with genetic risk levels for Alzheimer's disease.

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. We propose a dynamical-systems model of the AB, in which attentional load is described as the response of a dynamical system to incoming impulse signals. Non-task related mental activity is represented by additive noise modulated by meditation.

A mixed pattern of increased sympathetic and parasympathetic activity was found during meditation regarding heart-rate measures. Breathing intervals were prolonged during meditation. Participants perceived their body boundaries as less salient during meditation than while reading the story; they also felt time passed more quickly and they paid less attention to time during meditation. No significant differences between conditions became apparent for the metronome task.

Previous scientific investigations emphasize the importance of exploring the effects of such interventions in naturalistic settings to evaluate their implementation into daily life. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of three distinct mental training modules on a range of measures of daily life experience in the scope of the ReSource Project, a 9-month longitudinal mental training study comparing modules targeting attention and interoception (Presence), socio-affective (Affect) or socio-cognitive abilities (Perspective). We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to repeatedly probe levels of stress and stress-coping efficacy combined with stress-reactive cortisol levels, and further explored arousal, affective states, and thought patterns in the daily lives of 289 healthy adults (172 women; 20–55 years). We found increased presence-focused thought and heightened arousal after a training duration of 3–6 months, independent of the type of prior training. Increased coping efficacy emerged specifically after socio-cognitive Perspective training, following 6–9 months of training duration. No training effects were found for subjective stress, stress-reactive cortisol levels, or daily life affect. Our findings corroborate and add ecological validity to previous ReSource findings by showing that they replicate in participants’ everyday environment. Regarding endocrine and subjective stress markers, our results suggest caution in generalizing acute laboratory findings to individuals’ everyday routines. Overall, the current study provides substantiated insights into how cultivating one's mind through contemplative mental training translates to daily life experience, enhances stress-coping, and may ultimately aide in maintaining health. © 2022 The Authors","Ecological momentary assessment; EMA; Meditation; Mindfulness; RCT; Stress coping","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; adult; affect; arousal; Article; attention; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; coping behavior; ecological momentary assessment; female; human; human experiment; hydrocortisone blood level; interoception; life stress; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; mindfulness meditation; normal human; personal experience; randomized controlled trial; self concept; social behavior; social cognition; socioaffective ability; thinking; young adult; ecological momentary assessment; interoception; mental stress; mindfulness; Adult; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Interoception; Mindfulness; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130809970

This literature review aimed to synthesize the results of published studies on factors associated with symptoms in women during the transition of menopause and the Siddha way of management. All appropriate preclinical and clinical research data were analyzed in electronic databases like Pubmed, Scopus, and olden Siddha medical literature. Recent Findings: Nearly two-thirds of women have subjective cognitive difficulties, commonly identified to be difficulty in memory, attention, processing speed, verbal fluency, and motor skills during their menopausal transition. According to Siddha literature, vadha and pitha dosha produces the menopausal phase disorders. During menopause, symptoms like sleeplessness, nervousness, hot flushes, irritability, irregular menstrual cycle, urinary tract infections, incontinence, and osteoporosis are disturbing the women’s day to day activity. Scientific research strongly evidences that Siddha medicinal herbs and polyherbal preparations serve as an innovative platform for the search of drugs from alternate sources. Phytoestrogen containing herbs like soya, black gram, asparagus, and herbal antioxidants turmeric, green tea, bringaraj, and licorice gives a lot of relief to the menopausal women. Regular yoga postures, meditations, pranayamam, and Surya Namaskaram also support the women to get relieved from cognitive impairments. Summary: Based on the evidence of the present investigation, it was concluded that medicinal herbs and ther kayakalpa practices of Siddha medicines are alleviating the problems of menopause without any harmful effects. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cognitive impairment; Herbal antioxidants; Menopause; Phytoestrogen; Psychological health; Yoga","alkaline phosphatase; catalase; drug; estrogen; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; follitropin; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione reductase; Glycyrrhiza glabra root; Humulus lupulus extract; isoflavone; karisalai chooranam; luteinizing hormone; phytoestrogen; pitha dosha; progesterone receptor; reactive oxygen metabolite; red clover extract; secoisolariciresinol; serotonin receptor; siddha drug; somatomedin C receptor; superoxide dismutase; turmeric; unclassified drug; vadha; vitamin D; Vitex agnus castus extract; Withania somnifera extract; adho mukha svanasana; Alzheimer disease; antioxidant assay; asparagus; Asteraceae; attention; black gram; brain cortex; brain function; bringaraj; broccoli; cauliflower; climacterium; cognition; cognitive defect; DNA methylation; down regulation; DPPH radical scavenging assay; female; hippocampus; hormone substitution; hot flush; human; in vivo study; incontinence; insomnia; irritability; linseed; lipid peroxidation; meditation; memory; menopausal syndrome; menopause; menstrual irregularity; Morris water maze test; motor performance; nervousness; night sweat; nitric acid scavenging assay; osteolysis; osteoporosis; ovariectomy; pranayamam; prasarita padottanasana; processing speed; Review; salamba sarvangasana; setu bandha sarvangasana; Siddha medicine; sirsasana; soybean; supta baddha konasana; supta virasana; surya namaskaram; systematic review; tea; Terminalia catappa; upregulation; urinary tract infection; verbal fluency; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130748898

The treatment of AD through multiple pathological targets may generate therapeutic efficacy better. The multifunctional molecules that simultaneously hit several pathological targets have been of great interest in the intervention of AD. Methods: Here, we combined the chalcone scaffold with carbamate moiety and 5,6-dimethoxy-indanone moiety to generate a novel multi-target-directed ligand (MTDL) molecule (E)-3-((5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-inden-2-ylidene)-methyl)phenylethyl(methyl) carbamate (named AP5). In silico approaches were used to virtually predict the binding interaction of AP5 with AChE, the drug-likeness, and BBB penetrance, and later validated by evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) in vivo by LC-MS/MS. Moreover, studies were conducted to examine the potential of AP5 for inhibiting AChE and AChE-induced amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, attenuating neuroinflammation, and providing neuroprotection in the APP/PS1 model of AD. Results: We found that AP5 can simultaneously bind to the peripheral and catalytic sites of AChE by molecular docking. AP5 exhibited desirable pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics including oral bioavailability (67.2%), >10% brain penetrance, and favorable drug-likeness. AP5 inhibited AChE activity and AChE-induced Aβ aggregation in vivo and in vitro. Further, AP5 lowered Aβ plaque deposition and insoluble Aβ levels in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, AP5 exerted anti-inflammatory responses by switching microglia to a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype and preventing A1 astrocytes formation. The phagocytic activity of microglial cells to Aβ was recovered upon AP5 treatment. Importantly, chronic AP5 treatment significantly prevented neuronal and synaptic damage and memory deficits in AD mice. Conclusion: Together, our work demonstrated that AP5 inhibited the AChE activity, decreased Aβ plaque deposition by interfering Aβ aggregation and promoting microglial Aβ phagocytosis, and suppressed inflammation, thereby rescuing neuronal and synaptic damage and relieving cognitive decline. Thus, AP5 can be a new promising candidate for the treatment of AD.

Research documents the efficacy of these interventions for decreasing the burdens of stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders, and other symptoms. This article describes the case report of a patient with breast cancer, highlighting her personality, defense mechanisms, and traumatization connected with the disease. General information about the patient’s personal and medical history is presented in addition to the trajectory of psychoncological support, focusing on objectives, intervention strategies based on Mindfulness, and outcomes. The intervention is a combination of individual and group therapies, with particular reference to the use of Mindfulness in a group setting. The goal is to provide the patient with both a peer sharing experience as well as the tools to manage psychoemotional reactions through the development of awareness and a better relationship with herself. The main hypothesized consequences are an increase in self-esteem and coping strategies, which are necessary for a successful adaptation to cancer.

Aim: To examine the feasibility of a sexual health MBI, Mindful After Cancer, which was adapted to meet the needs of breast and gynecologic cancer survivors in a community setting and for delivery via videoconference. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the 8-week virtual MBI. Weekly sessions were 1.5–2 hours in duration and included guided meditations and group discussion about sexuality after cancer and mindfulness in daily life. Home practice activities related to both mindfulness practice and sexual health. Participants completed online surveys at baseline and 1-month post-intervention. A purposive sample of 10 participants were invited to complete a follow-up interview 2–3 months post-intervention. Outcomes: Primary outcomes included both qualitative and quantitative assessments of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the Mindful After Cancer intervention for sexual health in cancer survivorship. Results: Twenty-two women completed the intervention (Mean age 53.2 years, SD = 9.4, Range= 39–73), with time since diagnosis ranging from 1 to 27 years (Mean 6.0 years, SD = 5.9). Participants completed 6.8 sessions on average (Range = 2 – 8) and 77% reported that the time commitment was manageable. Both qualitative and quantitative findings support the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the intervention. Clinical Implications: Many cancer survivors experience sexual dysfunction and related distress after diagnosis and well after treatment ends, yet there are few interventions available. Improved access to effective interventions can improve the delivery of survivorship care and patient outcomes. Strengths & Limitations: The sample size is small for this pilot study, and a control group was not included. The intervention was offered over two time periods, one prior to COVID-19 pandemic and one during the pandemic, resulting in both limitations associated with potential differences between the experiences of participants and the opportunity to learn more about the feasibility of the intervention during times of crisis. Conclusion: Results suggest that virtual delivery of the MBI is feasible, acceptable, and appropriate for breast and gynecologic cancer survivors. Gorman JR, Drizin JH, Smith E, et al.

We tested this hypothesis in the ReSource Project, a 9-month longitudinal mental training study. Participants practiced three different types of mental training, targeting either attentional abilities (Presence Module), socio-affective or socio-cognitive abilities (Affect and Perspective Modules). We investigated plasma oxytocin levels, and their link to cortisol and subjective reactivity to acute psychosocial stress as a function of previous mental training (n = 313). In a subsample (n = 113), to better understand oxytocin's involvement in the effects of socio-affective training, we explored oxytocin, cortisol and subjective experiential responses to a single Loving-kindness Meditation (LKM) conducted after three months of Affect training (versus rest without prior training). We found that, independent of mental training, stress triggered acute oxytocin release. Following a single LKM, however, acute oxytocin release was unaffected. Training effects were only found in overall oxytocin release during both, stress and LKM. Compared to no training, 3-month compassion-based Affect training decreased overall oxytocin levels in the context of psychosocial stress, but increased overall oxytocin levels during LKM. Training-induced changes in overall oxytocin were unrelated to cortisol and subjective stress reactivity. Based on Quintana and Guastella's (2020) theory of oxytocin as an allostatic hormone with anticipatory properties, we interpret training-induced changes in overall oxytocin levels as alterations in the anticipated emotional relevance of specific events. After training socio-affective skills for three months, the stressful situation may have lost its emotional saliency, whereas the meditation technique itself gained emotional relevance. We conclude that changes in peripheral oxytocin release do not mediate stress reduction after mental training, and encourage the investigation of an allostatic concept of oxytocin in future research. © 2022 The Authors","Contemplative mental training; Cortisol; Meditation; Oxytocin; Psychosocial stress","hydrocortisone; oxytocin; hydrocortisone; oxytocin; adult; affect; Article; attention; cognition; cohort analysis; controlled study; emotion; female; human; human experiment; loving kindness meditation; male; meditation; mental function; mental stress; mental training; neuromodulation; normal human; oxytocin blood level; oxytocin release; social competence; Trier Social Stress Test; empathy; meditation; Emotions; Empathy; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Meditation; Oxytocin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127345947

It is also prevalent in patients with chronic liver disease, but the scope, depth, and safety of use is not well known. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and patterns of CAM use in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients. Methods: Electronic invitation to complete a 22 item CAM-specific questionnaire was posted weekly to well-established AIH Facebook communities (combined membership of 4700 individuals) during a 6-week study period. Age ≥ 18 years and AIH diagnosis made by a treating physician were the eligibility criteria. Results: The prevalence of ever CAM use among participants was 56.4%, and nearly 42% used CAM after AIH diagnosis. Among those reporting CAM use after diagnosis, 53.7% (51/95) indicated CAM was used to mitigate AIH-related phenomenon, most often targeting liver inflammation/fibrosis (67.7%), fatigue (51%), joint pain (47.1%), and sleep issues (45.1%). Most frequent physical CAM strategies were exercise (49.5%) and yoga (34%), whereas most frequent consumable CAM included healthier eating (45.3%), cannabidiol preparations (45.3%), and probiotics (44.3%). Seventy-five percent reported that CAM improved AIH symptoms and no severe adverse events were reported. Conclusions: CAM use in AIH patients is prevalent, yet providers have historically failed to document their patient’s CAM strategies. Beyond inherent drug-induced liver injury risk, drug-drug interactions remain a concern and could alter baseline immunosuppression levels in AIH. Despite a majority found CAM approaches that improved targeted symptoms, all were unable to alter the course of chronically prescribed medications by physicians. © 2021, The Author(s).","AIH; Autoimmune hepatitis; CAM; Complementary and alternative medicine; Supplement","ascorbic acid; azathioprine; budesonide; calcium; cannabidiol; diphenhydramine; melatonin; mercaptopurine; multivitamin; mycophenolate mofetil; mycophenolic acid; naloxone; naltrexone; prednisone; probiotic agent; sedative agent; tacrolimus; turmeric; vinegar; vitamin; vitamin D; adult; alternative medicine; arthralgia; Article; autoimmune hepatitis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demographics; drug indication; exercise; fatigue; female; hepatitis; hospitalization; human; liver fibrosis; low carbohydrate diet; major clinical study; male; meditation; questionnaire; Silybum marianum; sleep disorder; social media; symptom; time to treatment; vegetarian diet; yoga; adolescent; autoimmune hepatitis; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; prevalence; toxic hepatitis; Adolescent; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Hepatitis, Autoimmune; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Diseases; Prevalence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108621463

These symptoms can persist even in clinical remission and have a debilitating impact on social, work-related and intimate domains of life. Symptom self-management can be challenging for some patients, who could potentially benefit from an online self-management tool. Aims: We aimed to understand patients’ symptom self-management strategies and preferred design for a future online symptom self-management intervention. Methods: Using exploratory qualitative methods, we conducted focus group and individual interviews with 40 people with IBD recruited from UK clinics and from community-dwelling members of the Crohn’s and Colitis UK charity; data were collected using a digital audio recorder, and transcribed and anonymized by a third party (professional) transcriber. We used framework analysis for focus group data and thematic analysis for interview data. Results: The data provided three core themes: ways of coping; intervention functionality; and intervention content. Participants attempt to manage all three symptoms simultaneously, recognizing the combined influence of factors such as food, drink, stress, and exercise on all symptoms. They wanted an accessible online intervention functioning across several platforms, with symptom and medication management, and activity-tracking features. Conclusions: Patients reported numerous ways of self-managing symptoms of fatigue, pain, and urgency/incontinence related to IBD and expressed their needs for content, design, and functionality of the proposed intervention. Based on this and existing intervention development literature, the IBD-BOOST online self-management intervention has now been developed and is undergoing testing. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Fatigue; Inflammatory bowel disease; Online; Pain; Self-management; Urgency","adult; Article; audio recording; clinical article; community dwelling person; controlled study; coping behavior; defecation urgency; emotion; exploratory research; fatigue; female; follow up; human; inflammatory bowel disease; isolation; lifestyle modification; male; medication therapy management; middle aged; mindfulness meditation; pain; physical activity; pilates; qualitative research; self care; social media; social network; social welfare; thematic analysis; United Kingdom; web-based intervention; work from home; yoga; young adult; Crohn disease; fatigue; inflammatory bowel disease; pain; Crohn Disease; Fatigue; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Pain; Self-Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108326515

Although it has been empirically established that physical activity is a promising therapeutical approach to the prevention and management of T2DM, the effectiveness of yoga on T2DM has not yet reached an agreement across studies and also needs an updated synthetic examination. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of yoga training on diabetes-related indicators compared with usual care. Methods: The review protocol of this study has been registered in the PROSPERO with a registration number CRD42021267868. A systematic literature search through electronic databases was conducted to identify yoga-based intervention (i.e., randomized controlled trial [RCT]; e.g., yogic postures, movements, breathing, and meditation) studies reporting outcomes on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and body mass index (BMI). A number of two researchers manually reviewed and assessed each article using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. The literature search identified 296 eligible entries, of which 13 were finalized after screening using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The extracted data (group mean and standard deviation at posttest) were synthesized using random-effects meta-analyses. Finally, potential moderators were explored using subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Results: The standardized mean difference for the effects of yoga was significant on HbA1c (MD = −0.47; 95%CI: −0.77, −0.16; Z = 3.02, p = 0.003), FBG (SMD = −0.92; 95%CI: −1.55, −0.29; Z = 2.87, p = 0.004), PPBG (SMD = −0.53; 95%CI: −0.86, −0.21; Z = 3.20, p = 0.001), and TG (SMD = −0.32; 95%CI: −0.54, −0.10; Z = 2.86, p = 0.004). However, yoga effect was not observed on TC (SMD = −0.84; 95%CI: −1.71, 0.04; Z = 1.87, p = 0.06) and BMI (MD = −0.63; 95%CI: −1.42, 0.16; Z = 1.57, p = 0.12). Conclusion: The findings suggest that yoga can improve the biochemical indices of blood glucose and the lipid profile of patients with T2DM. Therefore, yoga can be prescribed as an effective and active complementary treatment for T2DM. However, this study only tested yoga as a short-term treatment. In the future, rigorous RCTs with a larger sample size may be carried out to examine the long-term effect of yoga on T2DM.

Currently available pharmacologic therapies, particularly JAK inhibitors, result in substantial reduction in symptom burden for patients with myelofibrosis, as well as select patient with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Non-pharmacologic therapies including yoga and meditation have also been investigated. In this review, we focus on the pathogenesis and assessment of constitutional symptoms in MPNs.

Methods: To clarify the role of meditation in modulating the heart-brain axis, we implemented an extreme phenotype strategy, i.e., Tibetan monks (BMI > 30) who practised 19.20 ± 7.82 years of meditation on average and their strictly matched non-meditative Tibetan controls. Hypothesis-free advanced proteomics strategies (Data Independent Acquisition and Targeted Parallel Reaction Monitoring) were jointly applied to systematically investigate and target the plasma proteome underlying meditation. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] as the potential cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed by electrocardiogram. Findings: Obesity, hypertension, and reduced HRV is offset by long-term meditation. Notably, meditative monks have blood pressure and HRV comparable to their matched Tibetan controls. Meditative monks have a protective plasma proteome, related to decreased atherosclerosis, enhanced glycolysis, and oxygen release, that confers resilience to the development of CVD.

A fundamental phase for understanding a bio-system under various conditions is to process the corresponding bio-signal appropriately. To this effect, different conventional and nonlinear approaches have been proposed. However, since the non-stationary properties of the bio-signals are not revealed by traditional linear methods, nonlinear dynamical techniques play a crucial role in examining the behavior of a bio-system. This work proposes new bio-markers based on the chaotic nature of the biomedical signals. These measures were introduced using the Verhulst map, a simple tool for characterizing the morphology of the reconstructed phase space. For this purpose, we extracted the features from the heart rate (HR) signals of six groups of meditators and non-meditators. For a typical classification problem, the performance of some conventional classifiers, including the k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and Naïve Bayes, was appraised separately. In addition, the competence of a hybrid classification strategy was inspected using majority voting. The results indicated a maximum accuracy, F1-score, and sensitivity of 100%. These findings reveal that the proposed framework is eminently capable of analyzing and classifying the HR signals of the groups. In conclusion, the Verhulst diagram-based measures are simple and based on the dynamics of the bio-signals, which can be served for quantifying different signals in medical systems. © 2022, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.","A hybrid classifier; Classification; Heart rate; Meditation; Verhulst diagram","Bioelectric phenomena; Biomedical signal processing; Nearest neighbor search; Phase space methods; Support vector machines; A hybrid classifier; Bio-systems; Biosignals; Heart rate signal; Heart-rate; Hybrid classifier; Meditation; Simple++; Verhulst; Verhulst diagram; Heart; adult; Article; Bayesian learning; breathing rate; cardiovascular procedure; classifier; controlled study; dynamics; electrocardiography; F1 score; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; k nearest neighbor; limit of quantitation; male; measurement accuracy; normal human; P wave; prognosis; QRS complex; radial basis function; scoring system; support vector machine; T wave; Verhulst map; Bayes theorem; heart rate; nonlinear system; physiology; support vector machine; biological marker; Bayes Theorem; Biomarkers; Heart Rate; Nonlinear Dynamics; Support Vector Machine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126456581

However, given the limitations in guideline development methodologies and inconsistent recommendations, it remains uncertain how best to design and implement non-pharmacological strategies to tailor interventions for breast cancer survivors with varied health conditions, healthcare needs, and preferences. Aim: To critically appraise and summarise available non-pharmacological interventions for symptom management and health promotion that can be self-managed by breast cancer survivors based on the recommendations of the CPGs. Methods: CPGs, which were published between January 2016 and September 2021 and described non-pharmacological interventions for breast cancer survivors, were systematically searched in six electronic databases, nine relevant guideline databases, and five cancer care society websites. The quality of the included CPGs was assessed by four evaluators using The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, second edition tool. Content analysis was conducted to synthesise the characteristics of the non-pharmacological interventions recommended by the included CPGs, such as the intervention’s form, duration and frequency, level of evidence, grade of recommendation, and source of evidence. Results: A total of 14 CPGs were included. Among which, only five were appraised as high quality. The “range and purpose” domain had the highest standardized percentage (84.61%), while the domain of “applicability” had the lowest (51.04%). Five CPGs were rated “recommended”, seven were “recommended with modifications”, and the other two were rated “not recommended”. The content analysis findings summarised some commonly recommended self-managed non-pharmacological interventions in the 14 guidelines, including physical activity/exercise, meditation, hypnosis, yoga, music therapy, stress management, relaxation, massage and acupressure. Physical activity/exercise was the most frequently recommended approach to managing psychological and physical symptoms by the included guidelines. However, significant variations in the level of evidence and grade of recommendation were identified among the included CPGs. Conclusion: Recommendations for the self-managed non-pharmacological interventions were varied and limited among the 14 CPGs, and some were based on medium- and low-quality evidence. More rigorous methods are required to develop high-quality CPGs to guide clinicians in offering high-quality and tailored breast cancer survivorship care.

We define ‘good’ or ‘bad’ sounds as those enhancing or inhibiting the cell’s biological activity, respectively. It is highlighted that the cellular dynamics results in a coherent organization with the formation of ordered patterns due to long-range correlations among the system constituents. Due to coherence, in the framework of quantum field theory, extended domains become independent of quantum fluctuations. Non-dissipative energy transfer on macromolecule chains is briefly discussed. Observed fractal features are analyzed by the fast Fourier transform and a linear relationship between logarithms of conjugate variables is observed. The fractal relation to the generation of forms (morphogenesis) and to the transition from form to form (metamorphosis) is commented. The review is also motivated by the suggestions coming from the cells’ responses, which show their ability to move from the syntactic level of the sound component frequencies to the semantic level of their collective envelope. The process by which sounds are selected to be good or bad sounds sheds some light on the problem of the construction of languages. © 2022 by the authors.

Methods: All members of an Antarctic expedition were included in the study. The participants were healthy volunteers allocated to an intervention group (n = 6) and a control group (n = 7). The intervention consisted of 8 weeks of Wim Hof training. The training program comprised three integrated parts: breathing exercises, cold exposure and meditation. Psychometric measures (the Beck Depression Inventory and the Trauma Symptom Checklist-40) and neuroendocrine measures (cortisol, melatonin) were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: The results showed that the 8-week training program significantly reduced stress responses, as indicated by a reduction in depressive symptoms. A non-significant reduction in cortisol was also observed. Conclusions: These data constitute preliminary findings indicating that the Wim Hof Method may positively affect stress symptoms and adaptability of the hormonal system to respond adequately to the circadian rhythm in healthy volunteers who participated in an Antarctic expedition. © The Author(s) 2022.","Cortisol; depression; hormone release; melatonin; observational study; psychophysiological training; stress; Wim Hof Method","hydrocortisone; melatonin; hydrocortisone; adult; Antarctic expedition; Antarctica; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; breathing exercise; circadian rhythm; clinical article; cold exposure; controlled study; depression; female; hormone release; human; male; mindfulness meditation; observational study; physiological stress; prospective study; psychometry; psychophysiology; scoring system; therapy effect; Trauma Symptom Checklist 40; travel; volunteer; Wim Hof psychophysiological training; meditation; procedures; Antarctic Regions; Circadian Rhythm; Expeditions; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Meditation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128533309

However, up to 40% of runners may experience exercise-induced dyspnoea as a result of cascading physiological phenomena, possibly causing negative psychological states or barriers to participation. Breathing techniques such as slow, deep breathing have proven benefits at rest, but it is unclear if they can be used during exercise to address respiratory limitations or improve performance. While direct experimental evidence is limited, diverse findings from exercise physiology and sports science combined with anecdotal knowledge from Yoga, meditation, and breathwork suggest that many aspects of breathing could be improved via purposeful strategies. Hence, we sought to synthesize these disparate sources to create a new theoretical framework called “Breath Tools” proposing breathing strategies for use during running to improve tolerance, performance, and lower barriers to long-term enjoyment.

There is scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese children. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of family-based comprehensive yoga intervention in the reduction of body mass index (BMI) in overweight/obese children, in comparison to standard dietary and lifestyle counselling and control group. Methods: This was an open-label randomized controlled study. Children aged 8-15 yr who were overweight or had obesity were randomized to one of the three arms for 18 wk; standard weight management (group 1), yoga with dietary modification (group 2) and control (no intervention; group 3). Reduction in BMI and improvement in physiological, biochemical and psychological parameters from baseline to 18 wk was compared between the three arms. Late follow up was also done at 6-12 months. Results: A total of 165 children with mean±standard deviation (SD) age of 11.6±1.8 yr and mean BMI 26.3±4.2 kg/m 2 were enrolled. Outcome analysis at 18 wk was performed for 109 children. Improved diet quality and reduced intake were observed in both intervention arms. The median (IQR) reduction in BMI in standard and yoga arms was similar [-1.4 (-3.1,-0.5) kg/m 2 and-1.2 (-2.3,-0.6) kg/m 2, respectively], while it increased by +0.3 (-0.3, 0.1) in the control arm. In the yoga arm, mean systolic BP reduced from 118 (10) to 114 (8) mmHg, (P=0.019). In the standard arm, significant improvement in psychological scores was noted. In group 3, the mean fasting glucose increased from 93±10 to 102±12 mg/dl (P<0.001). Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest that yoga in conjunction with dietary modification is equally effective as the standard weight management for BMI reduction in the paediatric age group. 2022 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Body mass index; body shape; diet; hypertension; insulin resistance; lifestyle; obesity; weight loss","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adolescent; Article; blood pressure; body mass; body weight; body weight loss; caloric intake; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; counseling; diet; dietary fiber; dietary intake; dietitian; electrochemiluminescence; female; follow up; food frequency questionnaire; glucose blood level; heart rate; homeostasis model assessment; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; medical research; meditation; nutritional assessment; obesity; outcome assessment; physical activity; pranayama; prevalence; questionnaire; randomization; randomized controlled trial; six minute walk test; socioeconomics; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; weight loss program; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139461290

In this study, we aim to investigate the presence and the management of pain in LIS patients. Fifty-one participants completed a survey collecting socio-demo-graphic information and detailed reports regarding pain perception and management (type and frequency of pain, daily impact of pain, treatments). Almost half of the LIS patients reported expe-riencing pain (49%) that affected their quality of life, sleep and cognition. The majority of these patients reported that they did not communicate their pain to clinical staff. Out of the 25 patients reporting pain, 18 (72%) received treatment (60% pharmacological, 12% non-pharmacological) and described the treatment efficacy as ‘moderate’. In addition, 14 (56%) patients were willing to try other non-pharmacological treatments, such as hypnosis or meditation. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of pain perception in LIS patients and highlights the lack of guidelines for pain detection and its management. This is especially pertinent given that pain affects diagnoses, by either inducing fatigue or by using pharmacological treatments that modulate the levels of wakefulness and concentration of such patients. © 2022 by the authors.

So far, studies have shown that practicing mindfulness on a consistent and regular basis can improve attentional functions and emotional well-being. Mindfulness has recently begun to be used in the field of child development. The goal of this study is to assess if a mindfulness program may help primary school students in reducing anxiety and depression while also improving their temperamental characteristics. This multi-arm pre-post study included 41 subjects recruited in the fifth year of two primary school classes. Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group, but not the control group, underwent an eight-week mindfulness training. Every week, the program included 60-min group sessions. QUIT (Italian Questionnaires of Temperament) and TAD (Test for Anxiety and Depression in Childhood and Adolescence) were used to assess temperament, and anxiety and depression, respectively. Both groups were administered both instruments before and after mindfulness intervention. The mindfulness program lowered anxiety levels and was effective in changing temperament dimensions: there was an increase in social orientation (SO), positive emotionality (PE), and attention (AT), as well as a decrease in inhibition to novelty (IN) and negative emotionality. Path analysis revealed that AT may promote the improvement of both SO and IN. Similarly, PE may be promoted by the decrease of IN. Clinical implications are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

While traditional cardiovascular risk factors play an important role in the development of IHD in women, women may experience sex-specific IHD risk factors and pathophysiology, and thus female-specific risk stratification is needed for IHD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Emerging data from the past 2 decades have significantly improved the understanding of IHD in women, including mechanisms of ischemia with no obstructive coronary arteries and myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries. Despite this progress, sex differences in IHD outcomes persist, particularly in young women. This review highlights the contemporary understanding of coronary arterial function and disease in women with no obstructive coronary arteries, including coronary anatomy and physiology, mechanisms of ischemia with no obstructive coronary arteries and myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries, noninvasive and invasive diagnostic strategies, and management of IHD. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The current prospective, single‐center, single‐arm study investigated if functional magnetic resonance imaging-based changes in cerebral blood flow and brain functional connectivity could be observed in 11 elderly adults (mean age 79) after participation in a Mindfulness‐Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. The results showed significantly (p < 0.05) altered cerebral blood flow and functional connectivity in the cingulate gyrus, limbic structures, and subregions of the temporal and frontal lobes, similar to findings of other meditation‐related studies in younger populations. Furthermore, these changes were also associated with significant improvements in depression symptoms.

The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of mindfulness-oriented meditation training (MOM) and autogenic training (AT) on a group of healthy Italian adolescents’ character dimensions, emotional and behavioral difficulties. Methods: 72 adolescents were randomly assigned to MOM/AT conditions and tested before and after the 8-week trainings through self-report measures (Temperament and Character Inventory 125, TCI; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for Adolescents, SDQ-A). Main analyses involved robust and repeated measures ANOVAs, carried out separately for character TCI and SDQ-A scales. Results: After trainings, we found increased levels of cooperativeness and reduced emotional symptoms. Changes in these dimensions were negatively correlated: the more participants increased in their cooperativeness the greater decrease they showed in emotional symptoms. Conclusion: Both MOM and AT enhanced a cooperative attitude in adolescents and helped reducing their emotional problems. Therefore, it may be useful to apply these mind-body interventions in school settings as they can have a protective effect on the well-being and psychosocial adjustment of youths, through fostering their character maturity and helping them to better regulate their emotions. © 2022 by the authors.

Eighteen population-based English empirical studies were included. We summarize the study designs and identify three CR models that were broadly used in these studies, including a residual model assessing lifestyle factors in relation to unexplained variance in cognition after accounting for brain markers, a moderation model testing whether lifestyle factors moderate the relationship between brain status and cognition, and a controlling model examining the associations between lifestyle factors and cognition when controlling for brain measures. We also present the findings for the impact of each lifestyle factor. No studies examined diet, sleep, or meditation, and only two studies focused on smoking and alcohol consumption each. Overall, the studies suggest lifestyle activity factors (physical and cognitive leisure activities) may contribute to CR and attenuate the damaging impact of brain changes on cognition. Standardized measurements of lifestyle factors and CR are needed, and mechanisms underlying CR need to be further addressed as well. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Brain markers; Cognition; Cognitive reserve; Modifiable lifestyle factors","alcohol; alcohol consumption; cognition; cognitive reserve; diet; evidence based medicine; human; leisure; lifestyle modification; meditation; physical activity; Review; sleep; smoking; systematic review; brain; exercise; lifestyle; Brain; Cognition; Cognitive Reserve; Exercise; Humans; Life Style",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121601183

What makes cancer so important is that the cancer incidence rate is growing worldwide which can have major health, economic, and even social impacts on both patients and the governments. Thereby, the early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment can play a crucial role at the front line of combating cancer. The onset and progression of cancer can occur under the influence of complicated mechanisms and some alterations in the level of genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome etc. Consequently, the advent of omics science and its broad research branches (such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and so forth) as revolutionary biological approaches have opened new doors to the comprehensive perception of the cancer landscape. Due to the complexities of the formation and development of cancer, the study of mechanisms underlying cancer has gone beyond just one field of the omics arena. Therefore, making a connection between the resultant data from different branches of omics science and examining them in a multi-omics field can pave the way for facilitating the discovery of novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. As the volume and complexity of data from the omics studies in cancer are increasing dramatically, the use of leading-edge technologies such as machine learning can have a promising role in the assessments of cancer research resultant data. Machine learning is categorized as a subset of artificial intelligence which aims to data parsing, classification, and data pattern identification by applying statistical methods and algorithms. This acquired knowledge subsequently allows computers to learn and improve accurate predictions through experiences from data processing. In this context, the application of machine learning, as a novel computational technology offers new opportunities for achieving in-depth knowledge of cancer by analysis of resultant data from multi-omics studies. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as machine learning can have revolutionary roles in the fight against cancer.

Many studies deal with the advantages and disadvantages of bioenergy therapies as an addition to established treatments such as chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation in the treatment of cancer. However, a systematic overview of this evidence is thus far lacking. For this reason, the available evidence should be reviewed and critically examined to determine what benefits the treatments have for patients. Methods: In June 2022, a systematic search was conducted searching five electronic databases (Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Medline) to find studies concerning the use, effectiveness and potential harm of bioenergy therapies including Reiki, Therapeutic Touch, Healing Touch and Polarity Therapy on cancer patients. Results: From all 2477 search results, 21 publications with 1375 patients were included in this systematic review. The patients treated with bioenergy therapies were mainly diagnosed with breast cancer. The main outcomes measured were anxiety, depression, mood, fatigue, quality of life (QoL), comfort, well-being, neurotoxicity, pain, and nausea. The studies were predominantly of moderate quality and for the most part found no effect. In terms of QoL, pain and nausea, there were improved short-term effects of the interventions, but no long-term differences were detectable. The risk of side effects from bioenergy therapies appears to be relatively small. Conclusion: Considering the methodical limitations of the included studies, studies with high study quality could not find any difference between bioenergy therapies and active (placebo, massage, RRT, yoga, meditation, relaxation training, companionship, friendly visit) and passive control groups (usual care, resting, education). Only studies with a low study quality were able to show significant effects. © 2022, The Author(s).","Bioenergy therapies; Complementary and alternative medicine; Healing Touch; Polarity Therapy; Reiki; Therapeutic Touch",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138868395

Complementary and integrative health approaches for pain are thus in high demand. One such approach is soft touch, e.g., adhesion of pyramidal thorn patches in a pain region. The effects of patch adhesion on pain relief have been confirmed in patients with various types of pain. A recent study using near-infrared spectroscopy revealed that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), especially the left side, is likely to be inactivated in patients experiencing pain relief during patch treatment. Mindfulness meditation is another well-known complementary and integrative approach for achieving pain relief. The relation between pain relief due to mindfulness meditation and changes in brain regions, including the DLPFC, has long been examined. In the present review article, we survey the literature describing the effects of the above-mentioned complementary and integrative treatments on pain relief, and outline the important brain regions, including the DLPFC, that are involved in analgesia. We hope that the present article will provide clues to researchers who hope to advance neurosensory treatments for pain relief without medication. © 2022 THE BIOPHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN.","Chronic pain; Complementary and integrative treatment; Mindfulness; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Pyramidal thorn patch",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129819298

Strong cultural taboos exist about sharing these experiences. Thus, many may not feel comfortable transparently discussing or researching these topics, despite growing evidence that these experiences may be real. The study's objective was to qualitatively evaluate first-hand accounts of noetic experiences. 521 English-speaking adults from around the world completed an online survey that collected demographic data and four open-ended questions about noetic experiences. Thematic analysis was used to characterize the data. The ten most used codes were expressing to or sharing with others, impacting decision-making, intuition/'just knowing,' meditation/hypnosis, inner visions, setting intentions/getting into the 'state,' healing others, writing for self, and inner voice. There were five main themes identified: 1. Ways of Engagement; 2. Ways of Knowing; 3. Types of Information; 4. Ways of Affecting; and 5. Ways of Expressing. Subthemes. Future research will include investigating the nuances of these themes and also establishing standardized methods for evaluating them. This would also then inform curricula and therapies to support people in these experiences. © 2022 Wahbeh H et al.","Intuition; Noetic; Noetic experiences; Parapsychology; Psychology; Qualitative; Subjective","adult; article; decision making; demographics; female; human; human experiment; hypnosis; intuition; major clinical study; male; meditation; parapsychology; psychology; qualitative analysis; speech; thematic analysis; vision; voice; writing; behavior; cognition; Adult; Cognition; Humans; Intention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129099448

Lifestyle behaviors, including diet and physical activity, may reduce the cancer burden. There is limited knowledge about the posttreatment lifestyle experiences of Hispanic survivors of cancer living on the United States-Mexico border. Objective: This study aims to support the development of a stakeholder-informed, culturally relevant, evidence-based lifestyle intervention for Mexican-origin Hispanic survivors of cancer living in a border community to improve their dietary quality and physical activity. Methods: Semistructured interviews with 12 Mexican-origin Hispanic survivors of breast cancer and 7 caregivers were conducted through internet-based teleconferencing. The interviews explored the impact of cancer on lifestyle and treatment-related symptoms, perception of lifestyle as an influence on health after cancer, and intervention content and delivery preferences. Interviews were analyzed using a deductive thematic approach grounded in the Quality of Cancer Survivorship Care Framework. Results: Key survivor themes included perception of Mexican diet as unhealthy, need for reliable diet-related information, perceived benefits of physical activity after cancer treatment, family support for healthy lifestyles (physical and emotional), presence of cancer-related symptoms interfering with lifestyle, and financial barriers to living a healthy lifestyle. Among caregivers, key themes included effects of the cancer caregiving experience on caregivers' lifestyle and cancer-preventive behaviors and gratification in providing support to the survivors. Conclusions: The interviews revealed key considerations to the adaptation, development, and implementation of a theory-informed, evidence-based, culturally relevant lifestyle program to support lifestyle behavior change among Mexican-origin Hispanic survivors of cancer living in border communities. Our qualitative findings highlight specific strategies that can be implemented in health promotion programming aimed at encouraging cancer protective behaviors to reduce the burden of cancer and comorbidities in Mexican-origin survivors of cancer living in border communities. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc.

In this study, we investigated the effect of an intensive period of Mindfulness practice on some biological mediators of stress and inflammation during a 3-day residential retreat. Methods: A total of 95 healthy individuals (aged 18–67) were recruited and randomized to a Mindfulness retreat arm or an active control arm. Before (t0) and after (t1) the intervention, all the participants were assessed for salivary cortisol levels and for a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines measured in saliva. Psychometric measures on stress, anxiety and awareness were carried out using PSS, STAI-Y and MAAS questionnaires, respectively. Results: As to the within-group differences, we observed a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress (β = − 8.85, p < 0.0001), and anxiety scores (β = − 12.39, p < 0.0001), while awareness increased (β = 15.26, p < 0.0001) between t0 to t1 in retreat participants. In the mindfulness intervention group, we also observed a statistically significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (β = − 0.94 p = 0.001) and IL-8 (β = − 176.40, p < 0.0001), and an increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 (β = 0.89 p < 0.0001) levels at the end of the retreat. At t1 we observed a highly significant correlation between cortisol levels and both anxiety (r = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and perceived stress (r = 0.92, p < 0.0001) scores. Conclusions: Mindfulness retreat participants showed a significant reduction in perceived stress and anxiety levels, as well as an improved balance of some key mediators of inflammatory states. Our data provide evidence that a mindfulness retreat may be effective in improving physical and mental health.

A large body of literature has investigated gene by environment interactions, particularly between the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) and negative environments, on the risk for depression. However, fewer studies have simultaneously investigated the outcomes in both negative and positive environments, which could explain some of the inconclusive findings. This is embodied by the concept of differential susceptibility, i.e., the idea that certain common gene polymorphisms, prenatal factors, and traits make some individuals not only disproportionately more susceptible and responsive to negative, vulnerability-promoting environments, but also more sensitive and responsive to positive, resilience-enhancing environmental conditions. Although this concept from the field of developmental psychology is well accepted and supported by behavioral findings, it is striking that its implementation in neuropsychiatric research is limited and that underlying neural mechanisms are virtually unknown. Based on neuroimaging studies that examined how factors mediating differential susceptibility affect brain function, we posit that environmental sensitivity manifests in increased salience network activity, increased salience and default mode network connectivity, and increased salience and central executive network connectivity. These changes in network function may bring about automatic exogenous attention for positive and negative stimuli and flexible attentional set-shifting. We conclude with a call to action; unraveling the neural mechanisms through which differential susceptibility factors mediate vulnerability and resilience may lead us to personalized preventive interventions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited part of Springer Nature.",,"amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; brain derived neurotrophic factor; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 4 receptor; oxytocin receptor; serotonin transporter; 5 HTTLPR gene; amygdala; anterior cingulate; antisocial behavior; anxiety; attention; brain function; burnout; cognition; cognitive flexibility; connectome; corpus striatum; default mode network; disease predisposition; DNA polymorphism; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; environmental factor; executive function; externalization (behavior); functional magnetic resonance imaging; gene; genetic association; heredity; human; image analysis; internalization (behavior); mindfulness meditation; neuroimaging; neuropathology; nonhuman; physiological stress; postnatal depression; precuneus; premature labor; prenatal stress; prevalence; psychological resilience; Review; salience network; social interaction; substantia nigra; task performance; ventral tegmentum; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; working memory; brain; genetics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Attention; Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101923015

They serve as independent compartments providing large amplitudes of Ca2+ signals to achieve synaptic plasticity, provide sites for newer synapses, facilitate learning and memory. One of the common and severe complication of neurodegenerative disease is cognitive impairment, which is said to be closely associated with spine pathologies viz., decreased in spine density, spine length, spine volume, spine size etc. Many treatments targeting neurological diseases have shown to improve the spine structure and distribution. However, concise data on the various modulators of dendritic spines are imperative and a need of the hour. Hence, in this review we made an attempt to consolidate the effects of various pharmacological (cholinergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, sero-tonergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic agents) and non-pharmacological modulators (dietary in-terventions, enriched environment, yoga and meditation) on dendritic spines structure and func-tions. These data suggest that both the pharmacological and non-pharmacological modulators pro-duced significant improvement in dendritic spine structure and functions and in turn reversing the pathologies underlying neurodegeneration. Intriguingly, the non-pharmacological approaches have shown to improve intellectual performances both in preclinical and clinical platforms, but still more technology-based evidence needs to be studied. Thus, we conclude that a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention may restore cognitive performance syner-gistically via improving dendritic spine number and functions in various neurological disorders. © 2021 by the authors.

This inference has motivated the development of lifestyle interventions for reducing cognitive decline. Typically delivered to older adults face-to-face, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated their adaptation for remote delivery. We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials of remotely delivered lifestyle interventions (≥4 weeks duration and delivered >50% remotely), for adults aged ≥ 60 without dementia, examining effects on objective cognitive measures. Comparators were active (face-to-face or remote) or passive. Ten studies (n = 2967) comprising multidomain (k = 4), physical activity (k = 3) or psychosocial (k = 3) remote interventions were included. Data were synthesized using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. The pooled estimate comparing the effect of remote interventions versus comparators on cognition was not significant (g=−0.02; 95%CI [−0.14, 0.09]; p = .66); subgroup analyses by type of intervention or comparator also yielded non-significant effects. Most studies had low risk of bias. Current evidence to support remote lifestyle interventions is limited. Included studies were conducted pre-pandemic, and evaluated individual, rather than group interventions.

Yet, there is hope that AD risk factors and thus the number of AD cases can be significantly reduced by prevention measures based on lifestyle modifications as targeted by non-pharmacological preventive interventions. So far, these interventions have rarely targeted the psycho-affective risk factors related to depression, stress, anxiety, and feeling of loneliness, which are all prevalent in ageing. This paper presents the hypothesis that the regular practice of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness and compassion meditation (LKCM) in the ageing population constitutes a lifestyle that is protective against AD. In this model, these practices can promote cognition, mental health, and well-being by strengthening attention control, metacognitive monitoring, emotion regulation and pro-social capacities. Training these capacities could reduce the risk of AD by upregulating beneficial age-related factors such as cognitive reserve, and down-regulating detrimental age-related factors, such as stress, or depression. As an illustration, we present the Medit-Ageing study (public name Silver Santé Study), an on-going European project that assesses the impact and mechanisms of non-pharmacological interventions including meditation, in the ageing population. © 2021","Alzheimer's disease; Anxiety; Cognition; Eudaimonic well-being; Medit-Ageing; Silver Sante Study","aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; anxiety disorder; cognition; cognitive reserve; depression; emotion regulation; history; human; hypothesis; kindness; lifestyle; lifestyle modification; loving kindness and compassion meditation; meditation; mental health; mental stress; metacognitive monitoring; mindfulness meditation; prosocial behavior; psychological well-being; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk reduction; aging; empathy; mindfulness; Aging; Cognition; Empathy; Humans; Meditation; Mindfulness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118825319

Identifying personal traits to make out by whom and why CAM is used can help physicians in successful physician–patient interaction, and thus improve patient’s compliance and trust towards their physician. Patients and methods: A questionnaire was passed on to cancer patients in an ambulant clinical and a rehabilitation setting. Multiple regression analyses were run to examine possible predictors for CAM use, such as gender, age, level of education, spirituality, attentiveness, self-efficacy and resilience. To differentiate within CAM users, two dependent variables were created: “holistic and mind–body methods”, such as Yoga, meditation or Homeopathy and “material based methods”, such as food supplements or vitamins. Results: Higher level of education, younger age and religion-independent attentiveness were significant predictors for the use of “material based methods”. Female gender, higher education and religious spirituality were detected as significant predictors for “holistic and mind–body methods”. Conclusion: This study is among the first to take a more detailed look at how numerous personal traits are associated with the use of CAM methods and differentiate between the applied methods. Our finding should be considered by conventional health care providers and could be integrated into a holistic assessment, to offer information about complementary medicine and meeting patients’ needs. © 2021, The Author(s).","Attentiveness; CAM; Cancer; Integrative medicine; Personal traits; Spirituality","amygdalin; acupuncture; adult; aged; alternative medicine; Article; attention; cancer patient; consultation; diet supplementation; educational status; female; health behavior; holistic care; homeopathy; human; ketogenic diet; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medicinal plant; meditation; mistletoe; personality; psychological resilience; qigong; rehabilitation; relaxation training; religion; self concept; traditional healer; vegan diet; vitamin supplementation; yoga; alternative medicine; middle aged; neoplasm; personality; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Aged; Complementary Therapies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Personality; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103616708

The Pathways to Wellness study, a randomized, multi-institution, three-arm trial, tested the efficacy of two behavioral interventions for younger breast cancer survivors with elevated depressive symptoms: mindful awareness practices (MAPs) and survivorship education (SE) (Clincaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03025139). METHODS Women diagnosed with breast cancer at or before 50 years of age who had completed treatment and had elevated depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to 6 weeks of MAPs, SE, or wait-list control (WLC). Assessments were conducted preintervention and postintervention and at 3-month and 6-month postintervention follow-ups. Analyses compared each intervention to WLC using linear mixed models. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale; secondary outcomes included change in fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms. RESULTS Two hundred forty-seven women (median age 5 46 years) were randomly assigned to MAPs (n 5 85), SE (n 5 81), or WLC (n 5 81). MAPs and SE led to significant decreases in depressive symptoms from preintervention to postintervention relative to WLC (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, –4.7 [–7.5 to –1.9]; SE, –4.0 [–6.9 to –1.1]), which persisted at 6-month follow-up for MAPs (mean change relative to WLC [95% CI]: MAPs, –3.7 [–6.6 to –0.8]; SE, –2.8 [–5.9 to 0.2]). MAPs, but not SE, also had beneficial effects on fatigue, insomnia, and vasomotor symptoms that persisted at 6-month follow-up (P, .05). CONCLUSION Mindfulness meditation and SE reduced depressive symptoms in younger breast cancer survivors. These interventions can be widely disseminated over virtual platforms and have significant potential benefit for quality of life and overall survivorship in this vulnerable group.

Acutherapy and mind-body techniques, such as meditation and yoga, have been shown to aid in symptom control and improve quality of life in oncologic patient populations, and the Society of Integrative Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology have recently endorsed a set of guidelines for the implementation of these techniques specifically in patients with breast cancer. Although the current guidelines focus largely on the management of chronic symptoms, there exists evidence to support the use of these techniques in acute symptom management as well. With surgical resection representing the backbone of many cancer treatment regimens, symptoms that arise during the perioperative period are prime examples of the acute symptomatology common among patients with cancer. Here, the authors provide a detailed literature review of the current evidence supporting the use of integrative techniques during the perioperative period and demonstrate their applicability for acute symptom management within oncologic and surgical populations. In doing so, the authors introduce a new paradigm of surgical practice they call integrative surgical oncology and integrative surgery. © 2021 American Cancer Society","acute integrative oncology; complementary medicine; integrative surgery; integrative surgical oncology","acupressure; acupuncture; alternative medicine; anxiety disorder; clinical practice; human; hypnotherapy; meditation; music therapy; nausea and vomiting; pain; perioperative period; physiological stress; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; surgical oncology; yoga; breast tumor; female; integrative oncology; neoplasm; oncology; procedures; quality of life; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Integrative Oncology; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Surgical Oncology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112748813

Since the current disease-centered care model does not address psychosocial factors, we hypothesized that holistic, patient-centered care integrating meditation and addressing psychosocial needs through a care coordinator will improve healthcare outcomes in CVS. Methods: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial: 49 patients with CVS (mean age: 34 ± 14 years; 81% female) were randomized to conventional health care (controls) or Integrative Health care (IHC) (27: controls, 22: IHC). The IHC group was assigned a care coordinator and received meditation with a certified instructor. Outcomes including psychological distress, coping strategies to manage chronic stress, cognitive symptom management, and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) were measured. Key Results: In intention-to-treat analyses, patients receiving IHC showed significant improvement in multiple domains of coping including positive reframing, planning, and reduction in self-blame (p values ≤0.05), and physical HRQoL (p = 0.03) at 6 months. They also leaned toward spirituality/religion as a coping measure (p ≤ 0.02 at 3 and 6 months). Subgroup analysis of compliant patients showed additional benefit with significant reduction in psychological distress (p = 0.04), improvement in sleep quality (p = 0.03), reduction in stress levels (0.02), improvement in physical HRQoL (0.04), and further improvement in other domains of coping (p < 0.05). Conclusions and Inferences: An IHC model incorporating meditation and care coordination improves patient outcomes in CVS and is a useful adjunct to standard treatment. Studies to determine the independent effects of meditation and care coordination are warranted. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","care coordination; cyclic vomiting; heartfulness meditation; integrative medicine","amitriptyline; aprepitant; diphenhydramine; ondansetron; topiramate; adult; anxiety; Article; care coordinator; chronic stress; clinical article; controlled study; coping behavior; cyclic vomiting syndrome; depression; distress syndrome; female; fibromyalgia; health care utilization; heartfulness meditation; human; intention to treat analysis; irritable colon; male; meditation; mental health care; patient care; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; religion; sleep quality; treatment outcome; integrative medicine; procedures; psychology; vomiting; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Female; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Male; Meditation; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Vomiting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103176132

This has led to an interest in mind body therapies as potential adjunct treatments for skin disease. The stress response results in the activation of the endocrine, neurologic, and immune systems, with a resulting cascade of impacts, that are both systemic and cutaneous. The 2 main arms of the stress response are the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The resultant release of cortisol, catecholamines, and neuropeptides has multiple effects. Clinically, these have been shown to increase skin inflammation, increase itching, impair skin barrier function, impair wound healing, and suppress immunity. Mind body therapies are those that focus on the interaction between the mind and the body, with the goal to influence physical function and impact health. These have been shown to ameliorate some of the harmful physiologic changes attributed to stress or to reduce harmful behaviors. In some cases, such as with biofeedback, they may also result in beneficial physiologic changes. Treatments such as meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, guided imagery, and others have been evaluated in the treatment of skin disease and have shown some benefits. Although randomized controlled trials are limited, these interventions have shown beneficial effects on itching, psychosocial outcomes, and even skin severity. These interventions have been evaluated in diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, trichotillomania, and others. Given the potential benefits, improvements in psychosocial outcomes, and a low risk profile, referral to qualified practitioners or multidisciplinary clinics should be considered for some patients. © 2021 Graubard et al.","Biofeedback; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Dermatology; Mind body therapies; Stress",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119066378

Treatment of ET and PV is based on the risk for subsequent thrombosis. High-risk patients, defined as older than 60, JAK2 V617F–positive patients, or patients with a history of prior thrombosis, merit cytoreduction to control blood counts, whereas a watchful waiting paradigm is utilized in low-risk patients. However, low-risk patients have a host of other specific management issues that arise during their disease course. This review will discuss the most common management issues specific to the care of low-risk patients, including anti-platelet therapy dosing, pregnancy, and indications for early cytoreduction. Recent Findings: Although low-dose aspirin is well established in PV, its indications and dosing regimens are less clear in ET. Recent evidence has supported twice daily low-dose aspirin in ET and observation alone in very low–risk ET patients. Pregnancy is not contraindicated in MPNs, and we recommend aspirin throughout pregnancy with consideration for prophylactic postpartum anticoagulation. High phlebotomy needs, symptom burden, and extreme thrombocytosis are common reasons for initiation of cytoreduction in low-risk patients, although we typically do not start cytoreduction for an isolated high platelet count alone. Recent data has also demonstrated a potential disease-modifying effect of interferons in MPNs, with some experts now advocating the early use of interferon in low-risk patients, although more mature data is needed before practice guidelines change. Summary: We evaluate the literature to inform clinical decision-making regarding these controversies, including most recent data that has challenged the “watchful waiting” paradigm. Our discussion provides guidance on common clinical scenarios seen in low-risk ET and PV patients, who face a myriad of complex management decisions in their care. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Essential thrombocythemia; Low-risk; Myeloproliferative neoplasm; Polycythemia vera","acetylsalicylic acid; analgesic agent; antidepressant agent; antihistaminic agent; Janus kinase 2; ruxolitinib; tamoxifen; antithrombocytic agent; acupuncture; antiplatelet therapy; bleeding; clinical decision making; cytoreductive surgery; drug efficacy; drug therapy; erythromelalgia; exercise; fatigue; gene mutation; headache; hematocrit; human; low risk patient; meditation; microangiopathy; paresthesia; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phlebotomy; phototherapy; physical activity; polycythemia vera; pregnancy; pruritus; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; skin tingling; therapeutic dose; thrombocythemia; thrombocytosis; thrombosis; yoga; animal; disease management; female; polycythemia vera; pregnancy complication; thrombocythemia; Animals; Aspirin; Disease Management; Female; Humans; Phlebotomy; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Polycythemia Vera; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic; Thrombocythemia, Essential",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114172660

Methods: The study involved 20 women yoga instructors (n = 20) who performed 10 min of HIHY (vigorous sun salutation). Upon completion, they were randomly assigned to either active (walking; n = 10) or passive (savasana; n = 10) recovery groups for a period of 10 min. During HIHY, physiological variables such as heart rate (HRpeak and HRmean), oxygen uptake (VO2peak and VO2mean), and blood lactate concentrations (peak La−) were measured. Energetic contributions (phosphagen; WPCR, glycolytic; WGly, and oxidative; WOxi) in kJ and % were estimated using VO2 and La− data. Furthermore, the metabolic equivalents (METs) of VO2peak and VO2mean were calculated. To compare different recovery modes, HRpost, ΔHR, VO2post, ΔVO2, recovery La−, and recovery ΔLa− were analyzed. Results: The results revealed that HRpeak, VO2peak, and peak La− during HIHY showed no differences between the two groups (p &gt; 0.05). Values of HRpeak, HRmean, METs of VO2peak and VO2mean, and La− during HIHY were 95.6% of HRmax, 88.7% of HRmax, 10.54 ± 1.18, 8.67 ±.98 METs, and 8.31 ± 2.18 mmol·L−1, respectively. Furthermore, WOxi was significantly higher compared with WPCR, WGly, and anaerobic contribution (WPCR + WGly), in kJ and % (p &lt; 0.0001). VO2post and recovery ΔLa− were significantly higher in the active recovery group (p &lt; 0.0001, p = 0.0369, respectively). Values of ΔVO2 and recovery La− were significantly lower in the active group compared with the passive group (p = 0.0115, p = 0.0291, respectively). Conclusions: The study concluded that high-intensity hatha yoga which was performed for 10 min is a suitable option for relatively healthy people in the modern workplace who may have hatha yoga experience but do not have time to perform a prolonged exercise. Following active recovery, they can participate in further HIHY sessions during short breaks. Furthermore, a faster return to work can be supported by physiological recovery. © Copyright © 2021 Lee, Ju and Yang.","blood lactate; energy demands; glycolytic system; oxidative system; phosphagen system; resynthesis","creatine phosphate; adult; anaerobic exercise; Article; body fat; body height; body weight; controlled study; energy metabolism; female; glycolysis; hatha yoga; heart rate; high intensity exercise; human; Korea; lactate blood level; meditation; metabolic equivalent; oxygen consumption; physiology; savasana; walking; workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116945047

We assessed individuals’ MW through a free association task and an attentional task with thought-probes combined with a questionnaire for the phenomenological characteristic of each MW episode. We used the Temperament and Character Inventory to assess participants’ personality traits and their associations with measures of MW. Our study was limited by the course of the Covid-19 pandemic and only nine healthy young individuals completed the testing sessions, which were carried out before and after the MOM training. After MOM, participants showed fewer repetitive and self-relevant thoughts and indices of better performance in the attentional task; the linguistic analysis of participants’ free associations showed lower verbal productivity and a decrease in utterances that expressed anxiety/stress. Overall, we foresee that future studies could replicate our preliminary findings with larger samples and in a period without a global health emergency. This multilevel approach to the study of MW may allow researchers to gain a broader view of the phenomenon, considering its occurrence, qualitative characteristics, impact on cognitive tasks, malleability via mindfulness or other psychological interventions, and relations with personality traits. © 2021 by the authors.

When viewing substantially different images in the two eyes (i.e., binocular rivalry (BR)), perception spontaneously fluctuates between the two images along with patch-like mixtures of the two, with limited ability to control such fluctuations. Previous studies have shown that long-term meditation training can enable a more stable perception by reducing such fluctuations. Using electroencephalography, we investigated the neural bases of perceptual stabilization in long-term meditators (LTMs) and age-matched meditation-naive control participants. We measured BR alternations before and after participants practiced meditation. We expected that perceptual stabilization through meditation could occur via one of two neurocognitive mechanisms: (1) a more engaged/effortful attention reflected by increased long-range phase synchronization between early visual sensory and higher-level brain regions, or (2) a disengaged/nonevaluative form of attention reflected by decreased phase synchronization. We found that compared with control participants, LTMs were in a significantly longer mixed perceptual state following concentrative meditation practice. The increase in mixed percepts across individuals was strongly correlated with reduced parietal–occipital gamma-band (30–50 Hz) phase synchrony. These findings suggest that concentrative meditation enables a nonevaluative perceptual stance supported by reduced communication between hierarchical visual brain regions. © 2021 New York Academy of Sciences.","attention; binocular rivalry; consciousness; EEG; meditation; perception","adult; article; attention; brain region; consciousness; controlled study; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; human; meditation; perception; standing; attention; brain; cognition; consciousness; physiology; vision; Attention; Brain; Cognition; Consciousness; Electroencephalography; Humans; Meditation; Perception; Visual Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116959262

However, there is a lack of data on its psychoneuroimmunological effects and of biomarkers to determine individual risk and to develop treatment strategies. We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the feasibility of deriving psychophysiological stress markers in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Thirty individuals with cardiovascular disease (mean age 58.8 years; 23.3% female) were enrolled and randomized into three treatment groups: standard rehabilitation, yoga, or transcendental meditation (TM). Depression, anxiety, sleep, stress perception, personality functioning, hair cortisol, serum tryp-tophan, kynurenine and neopterin concentrations were estimated at baseline and after a four-week intervention. Hair cortisol levels decreased significantly after rehabilitation in all groups (F = 15.98, p < 0.001). In addition, personality functioning improved in all patients over time. Participants with impairments in personality functioning showed a positive correlation with baseline neopterin that did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Concentrations of serum tryptophan and its metabolite kynurenine did not change significantly. This pilot RCT provides preliminary evidence of multicomponent CR leading to stabilization of hair cortisol levels and improved psychophysiological wellbeing and personality functioning. Impairments in personality functioning were correlated with neopterin levels, which may impact the symptomatology and outcome. © 2021 by the authors.

However, many cases of schizophrenia remain untreated due to failure to diagnose, self-denial, and social stigma. With the advent of social media, individuals suffering from schizophrenia share their mental health problems and seek support and treatment options. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used for detecting schizophrenia from social media posts. This study aims to determine whether machine learning could be effectively used to detect signs of schizophrenia in social media users by analyzing their social media texts. To this end, we collected posts from the social media platform Reddit focusing on schizophrenia, along with non-mental health related posts (fitness, jokes, meditation, parenting, relationships, and teaching) for the control group. We extracted linguistic features and content topics from the posts. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts belonging to schizophrenia and interpreted important features to identify linguistic markers of schizophrenia. We applied unsupervised clustering to the features to uncover a coherent semantic representation of words in schizophrenia. We identified significant differences in linguistic features and topics including increased use of third person plural pronouns and negative emotion words and symptom-related topics. We distinguished schizophrenic from control posts with an accuracy of 96%. Finally, we found that coherent semantic groups of words were the key to detecting schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches could help us understand the linguistic characteristics of schizophrenia and identify schizophrenia or otherwise at-risk individuals using social media texts. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aimed to investigate whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential diagnostic biomarkers of PD. Methods: Using RT-PCR, six downregulated major depressive disorder (MDD)-associated lncRNAs (NONSUSG010267, NONHSAT140386, NONHSAG004550, NONHSAT125420, NONHSAG013606, and NONMMUG014361) were assessed in 39 pregnant women with PD (PD group), 20 PD patients undergoing mindfulness-integrated cognitive behavior therapy (MiCBT) (treatment group (TG)), and 51 normal pregnant women (normal control (NC) group) to identify significantly differentially expressed lncRNAs during the second trimester and at 42 days postpartum. Results: Compared with the NC group, the six lncRNAs were significantly downregulated in the PD group during the second trimester and at 42 days postpartum (p<0.01~0.001). Expression of NONHSAG004550 and NONHSAT125420 was significantly upregulated after MiCBT therapy in TG (p<0.01~0.001), and no significant differences were observed between TG and the NC group at 42 days postpartum (p>0.05). NONHSAG004550 and NONHSAT125420 were significantly differentially expressed in the PD group, and this expression was altered according to the amelioration of depressive symptoms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the two lncRNAs combined had a good value in predicting PD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.764 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.639–0.888).

The results showed that FAM promotes WM performance in the medium (2-back), but not in the high (3-back) or low (1-back) demand condition, whereas OMM did not affect WM performance. A replication of the 2-back condition only (Experiment 2) showed no meditation effect, but a replication of the 3-back condition only (Experiment 3) produced a similar pattern as the 2-back condition in Experiment 1, with FAM promoting performance compared with OMM and the control condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that the single-bout FAM does promote WM performance but only if the capacity demands are neither too high nor too low. © Experimental Psychology Society 2021.","focused attention meditation; metacontrol state; N-back task; open monitoring meditation; Single-bout; working memory","attention; cognition; human; meditation; short term memory; task performance; Attention; Cognition; Humans; Meditation; Memory, Short-Term; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109417334

Design: A two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 12-month follow-up. In total 76 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either standard supportive care or to a 7-week meditation and mindfulness programme led by an instructor in addition to standard supportive care. Results: At intervention completion (after 7 weeks), perceived stress decreased significantly both in the intervention group (P = 0.001) and in the control group (P = 0.006). The decrease in perceived stress in the intervention group was significantly larger (P = 0.027) compared with the control group. At the 12-month follow-up perceived stress was still significantly decreased in both groups compared with baseline (P < 0.0001 in the intervention group and P = 0.002 in the control group). Conclusion: This first RCT of a tailored meditation and mindfulness intervention for women with RPL documents that a 7-week daily at-home meditation and mindfulness programme combined with group sessions reduced perceived stress significantly more than a standard supportive care programme.

The aim of this study was to determine how UK fertility clinic websites are advertising complementary therapy add-ons. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA) ‘Choose a Fertility Clinic’ website was used to identify fertility clinics and their websites. Acupuncture, reflexology, nutritional advice and miscellaneous complementary therapies were examined to determine treatment provision and costs. Treatment claims for acupuncture and reflexology were analysed using an inductive coding approach, and categorized depending on whether they pertained to holistic benefits, physiological benefits or improvements to IVF treatment outcome. At least one complementary therapy was advertised by 17 of 66 (26%) websites. Acupuncture was the most commonly advertised complementary therapy (16/66 clinic websites, 24%), followed by nutritionist services (11/66, 17%), reflexology (10/66, 15%) and other miscellaneous complementary therapies (9/66, 14%). Treatment costs were found to range from less than £50 for individual appointments to hundreds of pounds for treatment packages. Treatments were not always offered in-house at the fertility clinic, but rather patients were referred to an affiliated practitioner. Analysing claims relating to the complementary therapies highlighted that there were differences in the extent to which clinics claimed that complementary therapies benefited IVF, and that information occasionally acknowledged scientific research evidence but did not always present resources in an unbiased manner. Fertility clinic websites should provide accurate information for patients for complementary therapy add-ons. HFEA should add acupuncture and reflexology to their traffic-light system with amber and red ratings, respectively. © 2021 The Authors","acupuncture; complementary therapies; IVF; IVF add-ons; reflexology","acupuncture; advertising; alternative medicine; Article; endometriosis; fertility clinic; human; in vitro fertilization; infertility; leisure; marketing; massage; meditation; menstrual irregularity; mindfulness; nutrition service; ovary polycystic disease; reflexology; sperm count; stress management; subfertility; treatment outcome; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107700784

The current study aimed to test whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, an 8-week group intervention involving meditation and yoga, might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms among perimenopausal women. A secondary aim was to examine baseline characteristics, including sensitivity to estradiol fluctuation, as a moderator of treatment effects. Methods: 104 healthy women from the community in the menopause transition were enrolled and randomized to MBSR (n = 52) or a waitlist control condition (n = 52). Randomization was carried out using a random number generator and opaque sealed envelopes. Depressive symptoms, the main outcome, were assessed every two weeks for 6 months using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The occurrence of an elevated CES-D score (≥16) and of a major depressive episode were pre-identified secondary outcomes. The following surveys were used to assess additional outcomes of interest every two months: the Perceived Stress Scale, Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Baseline characteristics examined as potential moderators of treatment benefit included: baseline CES-D score, past depressive episodes, recent stressful life events, a history of physical or sexual abuse, and emotional sensitivity to reproductive hormone fluctuation. Outcome assessors were blinded to the participants’ assigned treatment arm. Results: Outcome data were available for 44 women assigned to MBSR and 51 women in the waitlist condition. Women randomized to MBSR reported fewer depressive symptoms, less perceived stress, less anxiety, increased resilience, and improved sleep (ps < 0.001). Furthermore, several baseline characteristics predicted a greater mood benefit of MBSR, including: a history of major depression (p for the interaction <0.001), a greater number of recent stressful life events (p <.001), being in the early menopause transition (p =.002), and an increased emotional sensitivity to reproductive hormone fluctuation (p =.004). There were no group differences in the occurrence of major depressive episodes (p >.05). Conclusions: MBSR appears to be an effective intervention for the prevention of depressive symptoms in the menopause transition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cortisol awakening response; Depressive symptoms; Estradiol; Menopause transition; Mindfulness based stress reduction; Perimenopausal depression; Perimenopause","adult; Article; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; Connor Davidson resilience scale; controlled study; depression; DSM-5; female; human; major clinical study; menopausal syndrome; menstrual cycle; mental stress; mindfulness; mindfulness based stress reduction; Perceived Stress Scale; perimenopausal depressive symptom; physical abuse; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prediction; randomized controlled trial; sexual abuse; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; climacterium; depression; major depression; mental stress; sleep quality; therapy; estradiol; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Estradiol; Female; Humans; Mindfulness; Perimenopause; Sleep Quality; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107162363

However, the effects of MBIs on stress-related physiological activity have not yet been ascertained. MBIs primarily consist of focused-attention (FA) and open-monitoring (OM) meditation. Since differing effects of FA and OM meditation on brain activities and cognitive tasks have been mentioned, we hypothesized that FA and OM meditation have also differing effects on stress-related physiological activity. In this study, we examined the effects of FA and OM meditation on autonomic cardiac modulation and cortisol secretion. Forty-one healthy adults (aged 20–46 years) who were meditation novices experienced 30-min FA and OM meditation tasks by listening to instructions. During resting- and meditation-states, electrocardiogram transducers were attached to participants to measure the R-R interval, which were used to evaluate heart rate (HR) and perform heart rate variability (HRV) analyses. Saliva samples were obtained from participants pre- and post-meditation to measure salivary cortisol levels. Results showed that FA meditation induced a decrease in HR and an increase in the root mean square of successive differences (rMSDD). In contrast, OM meditation induced an increase in the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) to rMSSD ratio (SDNN/rMSSD) and a decrease in salivary cortisol levels. These results suggest that FA meditation elevates physiological relaxation, whereas OM meditation elevates physiological arousal and reduces stress. © Copyright © 2021 Ooishi, Fujino, Inoue, Nomura and Kitagawa.","autonomic cardiac modulation; cortisol; focused attention meditation; open monitoring meditation; respiration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111581439

It is observed that there is a rampant rise in the rate of infection in spite of best possible precautionary measures taken into consideration against Corona. As there is no scientifically validated full proofed medicine against COVID-19 till date, the only possible way is prevention against this infection by improving self-immunity, mass immunisation and controlling non-communicable diseases, if suffered from. Another possible way from the prevention from this deadly virus is development of herd immunity, but the process takes time and can be fatal for people with higher age groups and with co-morbidities. Yoga, an Indian way of mind-body purification, has been reported to improve functionality of human physiological systems and to prevent diseases. It is also observed that yoga, being a low to moderate intensity physical activity, breathing maneuvers and meditation, can also be performed by any person irrespective of age, with maximum benefit and having less stress in the vital organs during the practice. Therefore, a yoga package for improving immunity and other physical and physiological capacities and mental function to prevent Corona like disease has been formulated on the basis of knowledge from traditional yogic literature and evidence from available research publications on yoga.

In this age of super specializations, one specific target and interventions (preferably a drug) on it are being rigorously sought by the health care community and industry, but have failed in it in the last fifty years in spite of advances in technology. Since, depression is a complex disorder associated with increased incidence of other complex disorders, it must be treated by an integrated holistic approach that can address the complexity of MDD.

It helps people to reduce stress and suppress negative thoughts. In this paper, we propose a camera-based meditation evaluation system, that helps meditators to improve their performance. We rely on two main criteria to measure the focus: the breathing characteristics (respiratory rate, breathing rhythmicity and stability), and the body movement. We introduce a contactless sensor to measure the respiratory rate based on a smartphone camera by detecting the chest keypoint at each frame, using an optical flow based algorithm to calculate the displacement between frames, filtering and de-noising the chest movement signal, and calculating the number of real peaks in this signal. We also present an approach to detecting the movement of different body parts (head, thorax, shoulders, elbows, wrists, stomach and knees). We have collected a non-annotated dataset for meditation practice videos consists of ninety videos and the annotated dataset consists of eight videos. The non-annotated dataset was categorized into beginner and professional meditators and was used for the development of the algorithm and for tuning the parameters.

It considers the high prevalence of CAM use especially among cancer survivors, particularly patients with hematologic malignancies and allogeneic stem cell transplant survivors, many of whom believe (because of extensive advertising) that supplements are anticancer/antitoxic agents, despite the paucity of evidence to support any benefit and the enormous cost to the individual. CAM constitutes various practices and nutritional behaviors including prayers, relaxation, spiritual healing, nutritional supplements, meditation, religious counseling, massage, and support groups. We highlighted the current literature regarding CAM practices and focused our discussion on the omnipresent nutritional supplements in particular to further expound on their benefits and adverse effects. As the number of survivors after HSCT increases over the next several years along with prevalence of CAM use, it becomes imperative to ascertain any beneficial potential, as well as toxicities associated with CAM use in this population. © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy","Cancer survivors; Complementary/alternative medications; Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Nutritional supplements","antioxidant; glutamine; nutrition supplement; vitamin D; alternative medicine; cancer patient; cancer survival; cancer survivor; clinical outcome; drug safety; health care cost; hematologic malignancy; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; human; leisure; massage; meditation; nutrition; prevalence; religion; Review; spiritual healing; support group; hematologic disease; meditation; survivor; Complementary Therapies; Hematologic Diseases; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Meditation; Survivors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104065811

Studies show that women’s brains are more sensitive to factors affecting mental health such as depression and stress than men’s brains. In women, poor mental health increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, and conversely, cardiovascular disease increases the incidence of mental illness such as depression. In connection with mental health and cardiovascular health, the presence of gender differences in brain activation, cortisol secretion, autonomic nervous system, vascular health and inflammatory response has been observed. This connection suggests that strategies to manage women’s mental health can contribute to preventing cardiovascular disease. Mind–body interventions, such as meditation, yoga and qigong are forms of exercise that strive to actively manage both mind and body. They can provide beneficial effects on stress reduction and mental health. They are also seen as structurally and functionally changing the brain, as well as affecting cortisol secretion, blood pressure, heart rate variability, immune reactions and reducing menopausal symptoms, thus positively affecting women’s cardiovascular health. In this review, we investigate the link between mental health, brain activation, HPA axis, autonomic nervous system, blood pressure and immune system associated with cardiovascular health in women and discuss the effects of mind–body intervention in modulating these factors. © 2021 by the authors.

Social distancing is critical for patients with cancer; however, it can also reduce their access to psychosocial coping resources. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore patient experiences to generate a model of how virtual mind-body programs can support the psychosocial well-being of patients with cancer. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among patients (aged .18 years) who participated in a virtual mind-body program offered by a National Cancer Institute.designated Comprehensive Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program consisted of mind-body group therapy sessions of fitness, yoga, tai chi, dance therapy, music therapy, and meditation. Live integrative medicine clinicians held each session via Zoom videoconferencing for 30-45 minutes. In semistructured phone interviews (n=30), patients were asked about their overall impressions and perceptions of the benefits of the sessions, including impacts on stress and anxiety. Interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Among the 30 participants (average age 64.5 years, SD 9.36, range 40-80, 29 female), three major themes were identified relating to experiences in the virtual mind-body program: (1) the sessions helped the patients maintain structured routines and motivated them to adhere to healthy behaviors; (2) the sessions enhanced coping with COVID-19-related-stressors, allowing patients to ""refocus"" and ""re-energize""; and (3) the sessions allowed patients to connect, fostering social relationships during a time of isolation. These themes informed the constructs of a novel behavioral-psychological-social coping model for patients with cancer. Conclusions: Virtual mind-body programming supported patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic through a behavioral-psychological-social coping model by enhancing psychological coping for external stressors, supporting adherence to motivation and health behaviors, and increasing social connection and camaraderie. These programs have potential to address the behavioral, psychological, and social challenges faced by patients with cancer during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The constructs of the conceptual model proposed in this study can inform future interventions to support isolated patients with cancer. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific benefits of virtual mind-body programming for the psychosocial well-being and healthy behaviors of patients with cancer. © 2021 JMIR Human Factors.

With an aging population and advances in PC detection and treatment, the need for better PC sexual health interventions is acute. Aim: Examine the feasibility of a mindfulness-based therapy group aimed at improving sexual intimacy for couples following PC treatments. Methods: A 4-session mindfulness-based group intervention was developed for PC survivors (mean age 65.6 yrs) and their partners (mean age 61.4 yrs). A mixed-methods approach was adopted to account for small sample sizes (N = 14 couples). Findings will guide future treatment refinement via participants’ lived experiences. Main Outcome Measures: Quantitative outcomes assessed pretreatment, immediately after treatment, and 6 months later included relationship adjustment, sexual satisfaction, sexual function, depression, anxiety, and mindfulness. Qualitative outcomes used Grounded Theory Approach following posttreatment exit interviews. Results: Effect sizes 6 months posttreatment indicated moderate improvements in overall sexual satisfaction and large increases in mindfulness in PC survivors, small decreases in sexual intimacy reported by partners, and small increases in anxiety in PC survivors and partners. Qualitative outcomes revealed 6 themes: (i) PC treatments must view PC as a couple's disease; (ii) PC treatments must consider the impact of illness on individuals and the couple; (iii) Mindfulness was a valued treatment modality; (iv) Individual factors contribute to outcomes, and therefore, must be considered; (v) Multiple perceived mechanisms for change exist; (vi) Group format is a therapeutic element of the process. Conclusion: An acceptance-based approach to sexual intimacy needs among PC survivors and their partners is feasible. While this small-scale preliminary study suggests that mindfulness may address some currently unmet needs among this population, randomized clinical trials are needed.

Postmenopausal women, cancer survivors, and women with a wide variety of pelvic floor disorders who experience genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD) are often advised to incorporate vaginal dilators into their pelvic floor rehabilitation program and treatment regimens to enable penetrative intercourse with less pain. However, little is known about the behaviors of dilator users, what treatment protocols are most effective, how patients are currently using their dilators, and how effective are clinicians in helping their patients achieve success with their dilation therapy. Methods: A recent PubMed literature search was performed using the key words vaginal dilator, vaginal dilator therapy, sexual quality of life, vaginal stenosis, vaginal dilation, vaginismus. A total of 29 English articles were reviewed and summarized. Articles were excluded for the following reasons: not in English and unrelated to dilator therapy. Main Outcome Measure: This article will summarize the current research on vaginal dilators and discuss needs for future research to maximize patients' compliance and success with this treatment. Much of the summary data regarding user behavior will come from the early survey data with Milli, a novel, patient-controlled electronic dilator that slowly expands 1 mm at a time from its smallest diameter, 15 mm to a maximum diameter of 40 mm. Milli is currently being used by more than 1,000 women, and 3-month follow-up data were recorded on 335 of those patients. Results: Dilators exist in multiple forms (plastic, latex, and medical grade material), may come individually or in sets, and many have special features such as vibration or the ability to be heated or cooled before use. Little is known about patients' use of dilators and the Milli's 3-month survey serves as an insight to patient dilator behavior. The most common medical goals for patients undergoing dilation treatment were return to penetrative intercourse and pain reduction during coitus. Patients were dilated on average 2.72 days/week; 56.8% of patients had suffered from sexual pain for 2 or more years and 36.3% had previously used static dilators. More than 70% of Milli users purchased Milli and are using Milli without the direct guidance of a clinician. The most common emotions patients used to describe their treatment were not only “anxious,” “frustrated,” but also “empowered” and “optimistic.” The most common dilatory session duration was 6–10 minutes, mostly in the evening/bedtime (68.3%), located in the bedroom (96.8%). Adjunctive treatment included the following: vaginal moisturizers, local estrogen products, coital lubricants, and genital pelvic floor physical therapy. During the dilation sessions, women most often watched TV/videos, practiced mindfulness, or listened to soothing music. Factors that showed trends toward improved patient outcomes were length of dilation treatment (greater than 3 months) and use of meditation and soothing music. Factors not associated with improvement trends were as follows: when/where patients dilated and patient demographics including age, race, or religious preferences. Conclusion: Patients who purchase dilators have often suffered with their condition for a long time and had difficulty finding a competent health-care clinician well versed in sexual pain syndromes that can help them. When patients did find a clinician, there were no clinically proven standardized protocols or formalized guidelines to give to patients about how to best use their dilators. Larger long-term interventions investigating a standardized dilation protocol are planned in future studies to better elucidate the effective and optimal dilation treatment plans.

This manuscript revises the scientific advances focused on the influence of internal factors on the human UPE. According to literature, the UPE seems to be influenced by some diseases (including diabetes, hemiparesis, protoporphyria, or a typical cold), and even by the cerebral intention/relaxation (brain activity/meditation). These allow to consider UPE as a natural and promising non-invasive spectroscopic tool for helping during the diagnosis of a variety of illnesses or stress- / mood-state disorders. Nonetheless, further research is required for answering some still unresolved controversial points. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Applications; Bioluminescence; Diagnosis; Human biophoton emission or ultra-weak photon emission (UPE); Internal states; Spectroscopy","cold injury; electroencephalogram; erythropoietic protoporphyria; hemiparesis; human; meditation; mood disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; photoelectron spectroscopy; photon; physiological stress; priority journal; Review; transcendental meditation; brain; diabetes mellitus; in vitro study; luminescence; metabolism; paresis; procedures; skin; ultraviolet radiation; reactive oxygen metabolite; Brain; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Luminescent Measurements; Meditation; Paresis; Photons; Reactive Oxygen Species; Skin; Ultraviolet Rays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100309718

However, the neural correlates of these changes and their links with inflammatory biology are not yet known. The present study examined whether a mindfulness meditation intervention was associated with changes in neural responses to threat and reward from pre- to post-intervention, and whether those neural changes were associated with changes in markers of inflammation in breast cancer survivors. Methods: This was a single-arm trial of a standardized, validated 6-week mindfulness meditation intervention. Participants were 20 women who had been diagnosed and treated for early-stage breast cancer. Participants provided peripheral blood samples and underwent a 90-minute neuroimaging scan before and after the intervention, with a focus on tasks known to elicit activity in threat- and reward-related neural regions. Results: There were significant changes in neural responses to the two tasks of interest from pre to post-intervention (ps < 0.042). Participants showed significant reductions in amygdala activity in response to threatening images and significant increases in ventral striatum activity to rewarding images from pre- to post-intervention. Although changes in amygdala activity were not correlated with inflammatory markers, increases in ventral striatum activity were correlated with decreases in circulating concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and the inflammatory marker CRP. Conclusions: These results, while preliminary, suggest that while a mindfulness meditation intervention can alter neural responses to both threat and nonsocial reward-related stimuli, changes in neural reward activity may be more closely linked to changes in circulating levels of inflammation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer; Inflammation; Mindfulness; Neuroimaging; Reward; Threat","C reactive protein; interleukin 6; adult; amygdala; Article; blood sampling; breast cancer; cancer survivor; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; inflammation; mindfulness; mindfulness meditation; nerve potential; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; reward; task performance; threat; ventral striatum; breast tumor; inflammation; meditation; reward; survivor; Amygdala; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Meditation; Mindfulness; Reward; Survivors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098108960

Thus, survivors often show an accelerated development of multiple geriatric syndromes and need therapeutic interventions. To advance progress in this area, the National Cancer Institute convened the second of 2 think tanks under the auspices of the Cancer and Accelerated Aging: Advancing Research for Healthy Survivors initiative. Experts assembled to share evidence of promising strategies to prevent, slow, or reverse the aging consequences of cancer and its treatment. The meeting identified research and resource needs, including geroscience-guided clinical trials; comprehensive assessments of functional, cognitive, and psychosocial vulnerabilities to assess and predict age-related outcomes; preclinical and clinical research to determine the optimal dosing for behavioral (eg, diet, exercise) and pharmacologic (eg, senolytic) therapies; health-care delivery research to evaluate the efficacy of integrated cancer care delivery models; optimization of intervention implementation, delivery, and uptake; and patient and provider education on cancer and treatment-related late and long-term adverse effects. Addressing these needs will expand knowledge of aging-related consequences of cancer and cancer treatment and inform strategies to promote healthy aging of cancer survivors. © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press.",,"antineoplastic agent; biological marker; cisplatin; dasatinib; doxorubicin; interleukin 6; isoflavone; mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor; phytochemical; phytoestrogen; protein kinase inhibitor; quercetin; reactive oxygen metabolite; somatomedin C; trace element; whey protein; adult; all cause mortality; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer chemotherapy; cancer model; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer prevention; cancer survival; cancer survivor; cancer therapy; childhood cancer survivor; chronic disease; clinical research; cognitive behavioral therapy; cognitive defect; diet supplementation; dietary intake; education; exercise; fasting; fibrosing alveolitis; frailty; health care delivery; healthy aging; human; imagery; integrative medicine; lung cancer; malignant neoplasm; meditation; mindfulness; music therapy; nonhuman; nutrition; preclinical study; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein intake; quality of life; Review; yoga; aging; cancer survivor; cognitive defect; complication; frailty; multiple chronic conditions; national health organization; neoplasm; pathology; United States; Aging; Cancer Survivors; Cognitive Dysfunction; Frailty; Humans; Multiple Chronic Conditions; National Cancer Institute (U.S.); Neoplasms; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101687560

Objective: We aim to compare the respiratory patterns in normal individuals, regular meditators and individuals with anxiety spectrum disorders, in an effort to automate the anxiety detection (AnD). Methods: Prospective cross sectional study which included 52 subjects, 20 normal population, 16 regular meditators and 16 subjects with anxiety disorders, was held at the Department of Neurology, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Kochi, Kerala, India (IEC: AIMS/2013/18). A 24 hours ambulatory monitoring of each subject was done during the sleep-wake cycle using the respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). We evaluated Respiratory Rate Variability (RRV), Thoraco-abdominal ratio (TAR%) and low frequency-high frequency ratio (LF/HF) for its effectiveness in AnD using p-values. Results: It was observed that RRV was lowest, TAR% and LF/HF ratios were highest in anxiety group compared to the meditation group (p=<0.001). Further, we developed a AnD system with statistical features derived from the respiratory signal, and LF/ HF ratio as its input, with a support vector machine (SVM) backend classifier. With the use of efficient signal processing algorithms to remove the effect of patient-specific variations in the feature vectors derived from the respiratory signal, we were able to obtain a performance accuracy of 92.30% absolute. Conclusion: The study highlights that we can automate AnD, and thus minimize the effect of subjective factors in assessing AnD and consider the LF/HF ratio as a new surrogate marker for autonomic imbalance. © IJCRR.","Ambulatory Respiratory Monitor; Anxiety Detection System; Coherent Breathing; Respiratory Rate Variability; Respiratory Signal Analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101504840

However, epigenetic modifications are reversible, and can be altered through proper intervention, thus mitigating the risk factors of T2D. Mind–body intervention (MBI) refers to interventions like meditation, yoga, and qigong, which deal with both physical and mental well-being. MBI not only induces psychological changes, such as alleviation of depression, anxiety, and stress, but also physiological changes like parasympathetic activation, lower cortisol secretion, reduced inflammation, and aging rate de-lay, which are all risk factors for T2D. Notably, MBI has been reported to reduce blood glucose in patients with T2D. Herein, based on recent findings, we review the effects of MBI on diabetes and the mechanisms involved, including epigenetic modifications. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the numerous sources of stress that are inevitable in daily life, effective management of stress is essential to maintain a healthy life. Recent advancements in wearable devices allow monitoring stress levels via the detection of galvanic skin response on the skin. Some of these devices show the capability of assessing stress relief methods. However, prior works have been limited in a controlled laboratory setting with a short period assessment (<1 h) of stress intervention. The existing systems' main issues include motion artifacts and discomfort caused by rigid and bulky electronics and mandatory device connection on active fingers. Here, we introduce soft, wireless, skin-like electronics (SKINTRONICS) that offers continuous, portable daily stress and management practice monitoring. The ultrathin, lightweight, all-in-one device captures the change of a subject's stress over six continuous hours during everyday activities, including desk work, cleaning, and resting. At the same time, the SKINTRONICS proves that typical stress alleviation methods (mindfulness and meditation) can reduce stress levels, even in the middle of the day, which is supported by statistical analysis. The low-profile, wireless, gel-free device shows enhanced breathability and minimized motion artifacts compared to a commercial stress monitor. Collectively, this study shows the first demonstration of soft, nanomembrane bioelectronics for long-term, continuous assessment of stress and intervention effectiveness throughout daily life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous stress monitoring; Galvanic skin response (GSR); Skin temperature; Stress management practice; Wireless soft electronics","Electrophysiology; Continuous assessment; Continuous monitoring; Controlled laboratories; Effective management; Galvanic skin response; Intervention effectiveness; Management practices; Stress relief method; Stress relief; Article; artifact; clinical practice; controlled study; daily life activity; electrodermal response; human; human experiment; job stress; meditation; mental stress; mindfulness; normal human; physical stress; pilot study; skin temperature; statistical analysis; stress assessment; stress management; wireless communication",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096160565

A growing body of research has examined the psychometric properties of popular mindfulness inventories for different population. The present study is aimed at exploring the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Relaxation/Meditation/Mindfulness (RMM) Tracker t Inventory in Iran. Method. This was a cross-sectional and methodological study that conducted in Kerman, southeast Iran. Fifty, 300, and 163 Iranian adult participants were participated in the pilot, exploratory, and confirmatory phase, respectively. Face, content, and structural validities, Cronbach's alpha, and Omega coefficient were used to validate the Persian scale. Results. The results showed that the ""Persian version of RMM t""had acceptable content and face validities. The Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) with Promax Rotation showed that the P-RMM t has 3 scales of ""Mindful Love, Thankfulness, and Transcendence,""""Relaxation,""and ""Mindful Deepening""which further confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis.

Some studies published previously have shown a strong correlation between hypertension and psychological nature including impulsion emotion or mindfulness and relaxation temperament, among which mindfulness and relaxation temperament might have a benign influence on blood pressure, ameliorating the hypertension. However, the conclusion was not confirmed. Objective. The meta-analysis was performed to investigate the influence of mindfulness and relaxation on essential hypertension interventions and confirm the effects. Methods. Systematic searches were conducted in common English and Chinese electronic databases (i.e., PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database) from 1980 to 2020. A meta-analysis including 5 studies was performed using Rev Man 5.4.1 software to estimate the influence of mindfulness and relaxation on blood pressure, ameliorating the hypertension. Publication bias and heterogeneity of samples were tested using a funnel plot. Studies were analyzed using either a random-effect model or a fixed-effect model. Results. All the 5 studies investigated the influence of mindfulness and relaxation on diastolic and systolic blood pressure, with total 205 participants in the control group and 204 in the intervention group. The random-effects model (REM) was used to calculate the pooled effect for mindfulness and relaxation on diastolic blood pressure (I2 = 0%, t2 = 0.000, P=0.41). The random pooled effect size (MD) was 0.30 (95% CI = -0.81-1.42, P=0.59). REM was used to calculate the pooled effect for mindfulness and relaxation on systolic blood pressure (I2 = 49%, t2 = 3.05, P=0.10). The random pooled effect size (MD) was -1.05 (95% CI = -3.29-1.18, P=0.36). The results of this meta-analysis were influenced by publication bias to some degree. Conclusion. All the results showed less influence of mindfulness and relaxation might act on diastolic or systolic blood pressure, when mindfulness and relaxation are used to intervene in treating CVD and hypertension. © 2021 Fushun Zhang et al.",,"Blood; Digital libraries; Random processes; Diastolic blood pressures; Effect size; Electronic database; Essential hypertension; Meta-analysis; Publication bias; Random effects model; Strong correlation; Systematic searches; Systolic blood pressure; Blood pressure; adolescent; adult; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; Cinahl; CNKI database; Cochrane Library; diastolic blood pressure; Embase; essential hypertension; female; human; hypertension; information retrieval; male; Medline; meta analysis; mindfulness; prehypertension; PsycINFO; publication bias; randomized controlled trial (topic); relaxation training; Review; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; therapy effect; transcendental meditation; Web of Science; essential hypertension; Essential Hypertension; Humans; Mindfulness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121655134

Prolonged activation of neurobiological stress systems as the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can result in long-lasting maladaptive alternations. This study investigated the effectiveness of Muse, a game-based meditation intervention, on the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and cortisol basal activity and reactivity to acute stress among adolescents with posttraumatic symptoms in residential care. The intervention consisted of two gameplay sessions a week, for 6 consecutive weeks. Seventy-seven adolescents with clinical levels of posttraumatic symptoms (10–18 years old) received either Muse as an addition to treatment as usual (n = 40) or treatment as usual alone (n = 37). We expected reduced basal activity for the SNS and cortisol and increased basal activity for the PNS. As for the response to acute stress, we expected decreased PNS and increased HPA axis reactivity. The Muse group exhibited lower basal activity for the SNS and increased HPA reactivity to acute stress. There were no differences between conditions on SNS and HPA axis activity during rest and on SNS and PNS reactivity to acute stress. Game-based meditation therapy is a promising intervention for the treatment of adolescents with posttraumatic symptoms in residential care. Implications for clinical relevance and trauma-focused treatment purposes are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

Prehypertension is a precursor for developing hypertension and is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Yoga therapy may have a role in lowering the blood pressures in prehypertension and hypertension. This systematic review aims to synthesize the available literature for the same. Methodology. Databases such as PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for randomised control trials only in the time duration of 2010-2021. The main outcome of interest was systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Articles were screened based on the inclusion criteria, and 8 articles were recruited for the review. Meta-analysis was done for suitable articles. RevMan 5.4 by Cochrane was used for meta-analysis and forest plot construction. Risk of bias was determined using the Downs and Black checklist by three independent authors. Results. The meta-analysis of the articles favoured yoga intervention over the control intervention. Yoga therapy had significantly reduced the systolic pressure (-0.62 standard mean difference, at IV fixed 95% CI:-0.83,-0.41) and diastolic pressure (-0.81 standard mean difference, at IV random 95% CI:-1.39,-0.22). Secondary outcome measures studied were heart rate, weight, BMI, waist circumference, and lipid profile. The main protocol of yoga therapy included postures, breathing exercises, and different meditation techniques. A significant reduction in secondary outcomes was observed, except for HDL values in lipid profile which showed a gradual increase in yoga group in comparison with alternative therapy. Conclusion. Yoga therapy has shown to be significant in the reduction of systolic and diastolic pressure in prehypertensive population. Supporting evidence lacks in providing a proper structured dosage of yoga asanas and breathing techniques. Considering the existing literature and evidence, Yoga therapy can be used and recommended in prehypertensive population and can be beneficial in reducing the chances of developing hypertension or cardiovascular diseases. © 2021 Janhavi Sandeep Khandekar et al.",,"high density lipoprotein; arterial pressure; blood pressure; body mass; body position; body weight; breathing exercise; checklist; data base; diastolic blood pressure; heart rate; human; lipid fingerprinting; meditation; meta analysis; prehypertension; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; waist circumference; yoga; pathophysiology; prehypertension; vagus nerve; Blood Pressure; Breathing Exercises; Humans; Prehypertension; Vagus Nerve; Yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116389888

Although several techniques have already been identified to control the pandemic or treat patients and causes of adverse impact on mental health, relatively only, fewer researchers have little concern about finding effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. Therefore, this study aimed to find some common and unique approaches to manage mental health during a pandemic. Some strategies for the better management of mental health induced by SARS-CoV-2 infections are required for all classes of peoples. Early management is vital, and those must be associated with frontline workers and people staying at home, particularly in isolation centers and already identified as active cases. Experts have pointed out the need to pay specific attention to proper daily life. To manage abnormal mental conditions, such as anxiety, mood, personality, and psychotic disorder during the pandemic; social media, meditation, and psychological motivation with adequate diet, exercise, and sleep have significant roles in regulating some biological mechanism, incredibly immune, hormonal, and neural process. Management of mental health is mandatory for all at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

They need to interact, they need to share. When things are going well everything is smooth sailing. When there is a deviation to this, ripples are seen. Youngsters are a representative lot of this society, who are used to socializing and hanging out with their peer groups, that when they are suddenly faced with a situation of social isolation and inability to mingle with their friends, is highly unpalatable and impossible for them. With the usual stress activators such as academic tests and exams they now have to face the new stress of forced social isolation. Such situational constraints will inevitably cause psychological, physical, and behavioural problems. Objective: The authors have taken for their study the anxiety felt by a group of students who have been forced into a period of social isolation due to situational demands. Methods: The researchers have identified four clusters of parameters to test the mindset of a select group of students. The four clusters contain questions relating to their mindset regarding missing friends, their understanding of loneliness, the psychological impact resulting from this situation, and the coping strategies they employ to tackle the situation. The test-retest methodology is being followed to analyze the data. Result: The analysis of data proved that prolonged periods of peer deprivation will induce the feeling of loneliness among students. Social isolation will make students suffer unknown fears, affect the sleep patterns of students. Not being able to go out and socialize causes stress among students, however, meditation reduces levels of stress among students. When the young minds are not able to meet up with friends like they used to just a few weeks back, they need to understand their problem is a global problem. The problem has to be tackled not only by individuals but also by governments. Conclusion: We face several challenges which have to be tackled both by the government and by individuals. The authors feel that teachers who have direct contact with the student community are uniquely positioned because of their networking with students almost daily. © IJCRR.","Behaviour; College students; Covid-19; Missing friends; Physiological; Relationships; Social isolation; Stress; Stress level",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105936633

Particularly, mindfulness meditation has various approaches related to dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and evidence has been provided that they alleviate depressive symptoms. In particular, as MBCT increases the level of evidence in the treatment of repetitive depressive disorders, guidelines are being recommended to prevent recurrence. Mindfulness may also contribute to improving the patient’s symptoms as well as improving the therapeutic relationship with the therapist.

As with any diagnostic condition, comprehensive evaluation, exclusion of other psychiatric conditions, assessment of co-morbid medical and psychiatric illnesses and psychosocial stressors are the keys to appropriate diagnosis and subsequent management. There are various management options available for the treatment of MDD, however, about 30% of the patients fail to achieve full remission of symptoms despite multiple trials and belong to this sub-category of MDD. This article brings forth discussion of other non-conventional medication and non-medication treatment alternatives that merit exploration of their efficacy in TRD. Many of the proposed novel medications and other treatment modalities such as Deep Brain Stimulation, exercise, yoga are already used for other medical and psychiatric disorders and have some evidence suggesting their potential benefits in TRD in conjunction with conventional medications or even as monotherapy. Nevertheless, more research is needed in this direction to establish effectiveness. © 2021 Kaur and Sanches.","Anti-depressants; Deep brain stimulation; HPA axis; Major depressive disorder; Pharmacology; Psychedelic agents; Treatment-resistant depression","adalimumab; agomelatine; antidepressant agent; av 101; avp 923; ayahuasca; celecoxib; cycloserine; deudextromethorphan; dextromethorphan; dextromethorphan plus quinidine; docosahexaenoic acid; esketamine; etanercept; fludrocortisone; icosapentaenoic acid; infliximab; lanicemine; lysergide; magnesium; metyrapone; mifepristone; minocycline; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pramipexole; probiotic agent; psilocybine; rapastinel; riluzole; rislenemdaz; ropinirole; scopolamine; serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1; testosterone; tocilizumab; unclassified drug; antidepressant activity; brain depth stimulation; cholinergic system; clinical effectiveness; dopaminergic system; drug targeting; exercise; glutamatergic system; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; major depression; melatonergic system; mindfulness meditation; monotherapy; nervous system; nonhuman; Review; SGK1 gene; supplementation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; treatment resistant depression; vagus nerve stimulation; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102208304

Diagnosing and treating primary sleep disorders, particularly in adolescents, can prevent the development of addiction in susceptible individuals. Addressing sleep issues in early recovery, and throughout maintenance, can prevent relapse. Cannabis use for insomnia shows mixed results; assisting with onset sleep latency in early use, this subsides with chronic use and holds addiction risk. Insomnia is a primary complaint of cannabis withdrawal syndrome and a primary cause of relapse in cannabis use disorder. An ideal sleep aid would prevent relapse and have low abuse potential.

This Afghan walking is a special kind of trekking called “holistic march”, the art of walking with one’s conscience. It includes a form of yoga that consciously absorbs energy from the air, synchronizing the steps with breathing pattern. Objective: The study aims to find the influence of mindful outdoor walking on attention on independent rural elderly. Methods: 192 subjects randomly selected into two groups (undergoing Normal & Mindful walking) were included for the study. Inclusion criteria: All independent elderly above 65yearsof both genders / Independent despite clinical diagnosis as Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, etc. / Post-surgical conditions like PTCS and CABG / medically stable cases excluding Medically unstable cases / Chronic illness & Life-threatening medical issue / Uncooperative, Psychiatric elderly patients / Amputation, Poliomyelitis / Hearing and vision deficit. Results: State Mindfulness Scale for Physical activity (SMS-PA). The intervention is of 8 weeks period with regular 30 minutes of walking sessions in the morning for 6 times per week including a10 minutes warm-up sessions / and cool down the procedure for 10 minutes. Using relevant statistical measures the outcome measure had been analyzed. It was observed that the elderly had improved significantly on both state mindfulness of the mind and body of Group B who had undergone Mindful walking. It is so important for physiotherapists to be aware of these strategies and incorporate them into the management of fall prevention among the elderly. Conclusion: The study concludes that it will have beneficial effects on the elderly individual’s instrumental activities of daily living. The study aims at formulating a self-reliant approach to the elderly and train themselves to their threshold levels of exercise capacity. © 2021, Radiance Research Academy.

To protect against the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization proposed intervening guidance that included movement restrictions, isolation, restriction of national and international travel or movement, and full or partial closure of organizations and institutions. Police personnel play a vital role in safeguarding the spread of COVID-19; thus, potentially causing severe stress due to increased consignment and direct exposure to infection during duty. The study aimed to determine the effect of the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and population lockdown on the sleep/wake 24 h rhythm of traffic police. A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","COVID-19; mental health; Pandemic lockdown; Sleep; Sleep/wake circadian rhythm; Stress; Traffic police","circadian rhythm; circadian rhythm sleep disorder; communicable disease control; female; human; India; information processing; male; mental stress; police; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; Circadian Rhythm; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Data Collection; Female; Humans; India; Male; Police; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092463375

Indeed, many large corporations have begun to provide workplace mindfulness training with the aim of improving group-based decision-making. Yet, there has been little empirical work testing the effects of mindfulness training on complex group-based task performance. In a randomised experimental study (N = 332), we examine the effects of two different durations of mindfulness training on strategic decision-making using the classic NASA survival task, assessing individual and then group performance. We expected that a longer training duration (seven daily sessions) would be associated with better group performance relative to a “one-off” training session. We did not find such an association: groups in the longer training condition made slightly, but not significantly, more errors than groups in the one-off condition. We did not find any differences across training conditions when examining individual performance. Our findings should be interpreted in light of numerous studies demonstrating the benefits of even short durations of mindfulness practice on cognitive performance. We conclude that our lengthier mindfulness training duration did not confer measurable benefits over a one-off training session at either the individual or the group level on a strategic decision-making task. © Experimental Psychology Society 2020.","experimental study; Group decision-making; meditation; mindfulness; trait mindfulness","attention; decision making; human; meditation; mindfulness; time factor; Attention; Decision Making; Humans; Meditation; Mindfulness; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095939183

However, the numbers of basic science papers for septic AKI account for only 1% of all publications on AKI. This may be partially attributable to the specific pathophysiology of septic AKI as compared to that of the other types of AKI because it shows only modest histological changes despite functional decline and often requires real-time functional analysis. To increase the scope of research in this field, this article reviews the basic research information that has been reported thus far on the subject of septic AKI, mainly from the viewpoint of functional dysregulation, including some knowledge acquired with multiphoton intravital imaging. Moreover, the efficacy and limitation of the potential novel therapies are discussed. Finally, the author proposes several points that should be considered when designing the study, such as monitoring the long-term effects of the intervention and reflecting the clinical settings for identifying the molecular mechanisms and for challenging the intervention effects. © 2020, The Author(s).","Acute kidney injury; Sepsis","antibiotic agent; atrial natriuretic factor; cholinergic receptor stimulating agent; endotoxin; acute kidney failure; antiinflammatory activity; basic research; blood vessel permeability; breathing; cholinergic activity; cold exposure; fluid resuscitation; glomerulus; glomerulus capillary; glomerulus filtration rate; hemodynamics; histopathology; human; intensive care unit; intravital microscopy; ischemic preconditioning; kidney blood flow; kidney cell; kidney proximal tubule; meditation; microcirculation; multiphoton microscopy; nonhuman; Review; Salmonella enterica serovar Abortus equi; sepsis; study design; urine volume; acute kidney failure; animal; complication; glomerulus filtration rate; kidney; kidney circulation; microcirculation; pathophysiology; prognosis; risk factor; sepsis; vascularization; Acute Kidney Injury; Animals; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney; Microcirculation; Prognosis; Renal Circulation; Risk Factors; Sepsis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089288366

Implementation of such cost-effective, persons suffering from chronic disorders would be beneficial for the diabetic population. This study was undertaken to understand the effect of Integrated Amrita Meditation®technique (IAM®) technique on stress and its benefit in attaining a better glycaemic control. Methods: Thirty type 2 diabetic patients aged between 30 and 65 yr were consecutively recruited for the study. They were randomly allocated to IAM®and control groups. Weight, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and perceived stress scale (PSS) were the variables assessed pre-and post-intervention during the three-month study period. Results: The mean changes between baseline and three months in the experimental group showed statistically significant decrease in HbA1c(P=0.018) as well as psychological stress (P&lt;0.001), whereas an increase in weight (P=0.046) and FBG (P=0.029) was observed in the control group. When the pre-and post-mean changes of the study variables were assessed between the two groups, the differences obtained were statistically significant for weight (P=0.048), BMI (P=0.055), HbA1c(P=0.034) and PSS (P≤0.001).

We pilot-tested a couple-based meditation (CBM) relative to a supportive-expressive (SE) and a usual care (UC) arm targeting psychospiritual distress in patients with metastatic lung cancer and their spousal caregivers. Patients and Methods: Seventy-five patient-caregiver dyads completed baseline self-report measures and were then randomized to one of the three arms. Couples in the CBM and SE groups attended four 60-minute sessions that were delivered via videoconference. All dyads were reassessed 1 and 3 months later. Results: A priori feasibility benchmarks were met. Although attendance was high in both groups, dyads in the CBM group indicated greater benefit of the sessions than those in the SE group (patients, CBM mean = 2.63, SE mean = 2.20, p =.003; spouses, CBM mean = 2.71, SE mean = 2.00, p =.005). Compared with the UC group, patients in the CBM group reported significantly lower depressive symptoms (p =.05; d = 0.53) and marginally reduced cancer-related stress (p =.07; d = 0.68). Medium effect sizes in favor of the CBM compared with the SE group for depressive symptoms (d = 0.59) and cancer-related stress (d = 0.54) were found. Spouses in the CBM group reported significantly lower depressive symptoms (p <.01; d = 0.74) compared with those in the UC group. Conclusion: It seems feasible and possibly efficacious to deliver dyadic interventions via videoconference to couples coping with metastatic lung cancer. Mindfulness-based interventions may be of value to managing psychological symptoms in the palliative care setting. Clinical trial identification number. NCT02596490. Implications for Practice: The current randomized controlled trial has established that a mindfulness approach to the management of patients’ and spouses’ psychospiritual concerns is acceptable and subjectively deemed more beneficial than a supportive-expressive treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We also revealed that videoconference delivery, here FaceTime, is an acceptable approach even for geriatric patients with metastatic NSCLC and that patients and their spousal caregivers prefer a dyadic delivery of this type of supportive care strategy. Lastly, this trial has laid the foundation for the role of mindfulness-based interventions in the palliative care setting supporting patients with advanced NSCLC and their spousal caregivers. © AlphaMed Press 2020","Caregivers; Dyadic intervention; Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer; Psychosocial care; Psychospiritual outcomes","adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; caregiver; controlled study; couple therapy; depression; emotionality; female; follow up; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Spiritual Well Being Scale; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; meditation; metastasis; mindfulness meditation; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; performance; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; spiritual well-being; supportive care need; videoconferencing; lung tumor; mindfulness; non small cell lung cancer; quality of life; spouse; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Caregivers; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mindfulness; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Spouses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089531916

Differently from traditional calligraphy, which emphasizes artistic expression, the system is designed to visualize the writer’s mental-state changes during writing using audio-visual tools. The writer’s mental state is measured with a brain wave machine to yield attention and meditation signals, which are classified next into the four types of emotion, namely, focusing, relaxation, calmness, and anxiety. These emotion types then are represented both by animations and color palettes for by-standing observers to appreciate. Based on conclusions drawn from data collected from on-site observations, surveys via Likert-scale questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews, the proposed system was improved gradually. The participating writers’ cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagements in the system were recorded and analyzed to obtain the following findings: (1) the interactions with the system raise the writer’s interest in calligraphy; (2) the proposed system reveals the writer’s emotions during the writing process in real time via animations of mixtures of fish swimming and sounds of raindrops, insects, and thunder; (3) the dynamic visualization of the writer’s emotion through animations and color-palette displays makes the writer understand better the connection of calligraphy and personal emotions; (4) the real-time audio-visual feedback increases the writer’s willingness to continue in calligraphy; and (5) the engagement of the writer in the system with interactions of diversified forms provides the writer with a new experience of calligraphy. © 2020 by the authors.

Furthermore, the pupil diameter oscillates spontaneously at low frequencies, sometimes referred to as pupillary hippus [3,4]. Oscillation amplitude varies with many neural factors, including arousal and cortical excitability. Here we show that pupillary oscillations are modulated by mindfulness meditation, increasing by 53% compared to pre- and post-meditation baselines. The effect occurs only in trained meditators and is specific for low frequencies (below 1 Hz), with delta frequencies (1–5 Hz) unchanged. The study suggests that pupil size may be a useful marker of the altered cortical state during meditation. Pomè et al. measured the diameter of the eye pupil in trained mindfulness meditators and found that slow spontaneous pupil oscillations are specifically enhanced during meditation, indicating that the pupils can betray the meditative state. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",,"attention; brain; human; meditation; mindfulness; physiology; procedures; pupil; Attention; Brain; Humans; Meditation; Mindfulness; Pupil",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090951844

Pharmacological treatments are often ineffective, leading to the development of a variety of behavioral interventions. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one such program that has shown efficacy in reducing gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and improving quality of life (QOL). This single-arm intervention study examines the association of clinical outcomes with changes in specific aspects of mindfulness. Methods: Adults with IBS (53 women, 15 men) participated in an 8-week MBSR class. Primary outcomes of GI symptom severity, quality of life, and GI-specific anxiety, as well as specific aspects of mindfulness using the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), were assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-month follow-up. Key Results: Gastrointestinal symptom responder rate was 71%, and there was a significant pre-post treatment change for three of the five FFMQ scales. Regression analysis indicated that change in the Act with Awareness (P =.02) facet of mindfulness was the strongest predictor of GI symptom and QOL improvement. Conclusions & Inferences: Mindfulness-based stress reduction training was associated with robust improvements in GI symptoms and associated problems in participants with IBS. Although significant increases in 3 of the 5 measured facets of mindfulness were found, regression analyses suggest that increases in the ability to retain present moment focus and act with awareness may be particularly important for improving outcomes in individuals with IBS. These results may inform the refinement of mindfulness-based protocols specifically for treatment of IBS. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","irritable bowel syndrome; meditation; mindfulness; visceral sensitivity","adult; anxiety; Article; awareness; clinical outcome; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; defecation habit; depression; digestive system disease assessment; disease severity; female; Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire; follow up; gastrointestinal symptom; human; Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System; irritable colon; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mental function assessment; mindfulness based stress reduction; mindfulness meditation; Pain Catastrophizing scale; patient health questionnaire; priority journal; quality of life; scoring system; stress management; treatment duration; treatment response; behavior therapy; irritable colon; mental stress; mindfulness; procedures; psychology; severity of illness index; Adult; Behavior Therapy; Female; Humans; Irritable Bowel Syndrome; Male; Mindfulness; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082964620

However, the molecular mechanisms for glioma progression are still unclear, lacking effective therapeutic strategies. Gomisin J (GomJ) is a derivative of lignan compound, and shows regulatory effects on virus, oxidative stress and tumor progression. However, the role of GomJ in the meditation of glioma progression has not been explored. In this study, we found that GomJ markedly reduced the proliferation of glioma cell lines. Mitochondrial apoptosis was highly induced by GomJ, as evidenced by the significantly up-regulated expression of cytoplastic Cyto-c and cleaved Caspase-3. In addition, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and oxidative stress were highly triggered in GomJ-incubated glioma cells, accompanied with the glycolysis suppression. Importantly, we found that GomJ could dramatically reduce the expression of hexokinase II (HKII) in glioma cells. At the same time, the dissociation of HKII from voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in mitochondria was markedly induced by GomJ, contributing to glycolytic repression. The in vivo experiments confirmed that GomJ obviously reduced the growth of glioma with HKII reduction and few side effects. Taken together, these results demonstrated that GomJ could inhibit the proliferation, induce apoptosis and restrain HKII-regulated glycolysis during glioma progression. Herein, GomJ with few toxicity might be served as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of glioma in humans. © 2020","Glioma; Glycolysis; Gomisin J; HKII; Mitochondrial apoptosis","caspase 3; cisplatin; gomisin; hexokinase; voltage dependent anion channel; antineoplastic agent; gomisin; hexokinase; HK2 protein, human; lignan; polycyclic hydrocarbon; voltage dependent anion channel; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme binding; glioma; glioma cell line; glycolysis; human; human cell; in vivo study; male; mitochondrial membrane potential; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; upregulation; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; chemistry; disease exacerbation; drug effect; drug screening; glioma; glycolysis; metabolism; mitochondrion; nude mouse; pathology; Schisandra; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Progression; Glioma; Glycolysis; Hexokinase; Humans; Lignans; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; Polycyclic Compounds; Schisandra; Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085768371

Apomorphine (APOM), a nonselective dopamine agonist, has been used to treat patients with advanced PD showing no response to levodopa or other dopamine agonists. Although APOM plays a role as a free radical scavenger with neuroprotective effect, it has been reported that long-term use of APOM in PD treatment brings about side effects such as nausea and orthostatic hypotension. For safe use of APOM in PD treatment, it is crucial to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of APOM in PD. In this study, two groups of microarray data including PD cell model and APOM added PD cell model were used to survey mediation effects of APOM in PD cell model. Mediation analysis between disease genes obtained from PD cell model and drug genes obtained from APOM added PD cell model was carried out with shortest path model on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways and partial least squares structure equation modeling.

Numerous antihypertensive medications and lifestyle changes have proven effective for the reduction of blood pressure (BP). Over the past few decades, the emergence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)-based strategies to lower BP have broadened the therapeutic armamentarium for hypertension. CAM is defined as a group of heterogeneous medical treatments that are used to enhance the effect of standard therapy, or, conversely, are implemented as an alternative to standard practice. The available body of evidence does substantiate the BP-lowering effects of certain CAM-based therapies in individuals with and without established hypertension. Collectively, alternative strategies for BP reduction have undergone less rigorous testing than traditional BP-lowering strategies and the lack of robust clinical data has greatly hampered the broad-scale adoption of CAM therapies into clinical practice. Despite these limitations, CAM-based therapies for the reduction of BP require consideration as they could offer substantial public health benefits given the high prevalence of hypertension in the general population. This article reviews some of the most promising CAM-based therapies for the reduction of BP and cardiovascular outcomes based on the current literature. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The limited evidence available indicates that changes associated with endocrine function following meditation correspond with improvements in mental health. However, this field of study is hampered by a lack of consensus as to definition and types of meditation and the mixed quality of reported studies. Moreover, the exact mechanisms by which meditation operates remain unclear and more robust studies are required to explore this by delineating the target populations, forms, dosages, and modes of delivery of meditation, comparison groups, and health experiences and outcomes used. © 2020","endocrine; health; meditation; wellbeing","consensus; controlled study; endocrine system; field study; human; human experiment; meditation; outcome assessment; review; wellbeing; animal; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; metabolism; Animals; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Meditation; Pituitary-Adrenal System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078986640

Past investigations have shown that mindfulness-based interventions are effective in improving symptoms of anxiety and depression in both adolescents and adults, making this a promising natural approach to treating mood disorders. The current study sought to examine the neurophysiological effects of a 10-week MMI, in a relatively unexplored age-range (7-10 years). The nonclinical participants demonstrated increases in interhemispheric alpha coherence, as well as increased theta, alpha, and beta power particularly in frontal and central areas; reflecting a lower neurological risk for anxiety development. However, two common measures linked to anxiety, frontal and posterior alpha asymmetry remained largely unchanged following the training period. Still, these preliminary results exemplify the potentially positive effects of mindfulness meditation on preadolescents; this time on neurophysiological functioning. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.","developmental disorders; EEG and anxiety; mindfulness meditation and anxiety; neurophysiology of anxiety and depression; preadolescent anxiety","anxiety; Article; burnout; Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale; child; Clinical Global Impression scale; cognitive therapy; depression; electroencephalogram; emotionality; event related potential; female; functional connectivity; human; life satisfaction; Likert scale; male; mindfulness meditation; music therapy; neurophysiology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; polysomnography; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; prefrontal cortex; preschool child; principal component analysis; psychometry; questionnaire; rating scale; skin conductance; transcranial magnetic stimulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068499984

However, current therapeutic regimens (atovaquone + azithromycin) for human babesiosis are suboptimal with frequent recrudescence and side effects, and furthermore, there is no specific treatment for human babesiosis caused by B. duncani. Here, we screened 97 essential oils and identified 10 essential oils (garlic, black pepper, tarragon, palo santo, coconut, pine, meditation, cajeput, moringa, and stress relief) at a low concentration (0.001%; v/v) that showed good inhibitory activity against B. duncani in the hamster red blood cell culture model. Among them, garlic oil and black pepper oil performed best, as well as their potential active ingredients diallyl disulfide (DADS) and β-caryophyllene (BCP), respectively. Interestingly, further subculture study indicated that B. duncani could relapse after treatment with current therapeutic drugs atovaquone or azithromycin even at high concentrations. In contrast, the combination of garlic oil or DADS and azithromycin showed eradication of B. duncani at low concentrations without regrowth. These results are encouraging and suggest that the garlic-derived sulfur compound DADS and β-caryophyllene (BCP) may be promising drug candidates for evaluation of their ability to cure persistent B. duncani infections in the future. © 2020 by the authors.","Babesia duncani; Black pepper oil; Diallyl disulfide (DADS); Essential oil screen; Garlic oil; β-caryophyllene (BCP)","antiparasitic agent; atovaquone; azithromycin; black pepper oil; caryophyllene; diallyl disulfide; essential oil; garlic oil; unclassified drug; animal experiment; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; antiparasitic activity; Article; autofluorescence; babesia duncani; blood sampling; broth dilution; cell viability; comet assay; controlled study; hematocrit; IC50; minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; parasite; parasite identification; parasite isolation; parasitemia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088415891

While insightful, open questions remain. For example, which timescale is best to examine the effects of meditation and related practices on HRV? Furthermore, how might advanced time-series analyses-such as stationarity-be able to examine dynamic changes in the mean and variance of the HRV signal across time? Here we apply such methods to previously published data, which measured HRV pre- A nd post- A two-week compassionate mind training (CMT) intervention. Inspection of these data reveals that a visualization of HRV correlations across resting and compassion meditation states, pre- A nd post-two-week training, is retained across numerous recording timescales. Here, the fractal-like nature of our data indicates that the accuracy of representing HRV data can exist across timescales, albeit with greater or lesser granularity. Interestingly, inspection of the HRV signal at Time 2 compassion meditation versus Time 1 revealed a more highly correlated (i.e. potentially more stable) signal. We followed up these results with tests of stationarity, which revealed Time 2 had a less stochastic (variable) signal than Time 1, and a measure of distance in the time series, which showed that Time 2 had less of an average difference between rest and meditation than at Time 1. Our results provide novel assessment of visual and statistical markers of HRV change across distinct experimental states. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Methods Fifty-eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study, 48 participated on two days, one week apart, during the same timeslot. The Karolinska sleepiness scale was used to evaluate current subjective sleepiness, and the relative pupillary unrest index to assess objective sleepiness. In this randomized cross-over study, the intervention consisted of a 20-minute stay in a hammock while the singing bowl, positioned beneath, was struck seven times. The controlled comparator was a 20-minute stay in the same hammock above the singing bowl, but without being struck. After these two interventions subjective and objective sleepiness were re-evaluated. Results The mean relative pupillary unrest index values after relaxation in the struck and silent singing bowl groups were 0.74 and respectively 0.71 (p = 0.460). The median Karolinska sleepiness scale value after relaxation with the struck singing bowl was 3 compared with 4 (p = 0.041) for the silent singing bowl. Discussion This study evaluated the influence of a struck singing bowl on sleepiness during daytime. Subjective sleepiness was significantly lower after relaxation above a struck singing bowl. After gender stratification, the difference was still significant in women. Objective sleepiness was not different in both groups. Finally, we can only speculate if women may be more susceptible to subjective improvements in case of sleepiness and show another perception of relaxation in a struck singing bowl compared to men. © 2020 Bergmann et al.

This investigation examines the impact of meditation on the said outcomes for older adults in assisted living facilities. Older adults (N = 136) from four assisted living facilities in Mumbai and Pretoria were randomized into intervention and waitlist control groups. Method: The Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) was used as a screening instrument for recruitment (cutoff total index score = 86 ± 4). RBANS, the Simple Object Span Test (SOST), and the Picture Span Test (PST) were used to assess the outcomes. The intervention group underwent a 90-day meditation training complemented with self-practice. Results: Posttest scores of the intervention group were higher. Older adult men, with college degree, middle class, widowed, in fair health, with no diagnosed psychiatric conditions, who attended at least 70 (out of 90) meditation lessons and who self-practiced at least 70 times, gained more from the meditation intervention. Intervention compliance had the strongest effect on posttest outcomes as well as sex and psychiatric morbidities. Conclusion: Meditation intervention needs some refinements for older adult women, with high school education, upper class, currently married, in poor health, with diagnosed anxiety/depression/drug dependence, who attended fewer meditation lessons and self-practiced infrequently. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"aged; aging; assisted living facility; controlled study; female; human; India; male; meditation; neuropsychological test; physiology; psychology; randomized controlled trial; short term memory; South Africa; Aged; Aging; Assisted Living Facilities; Female; Humans; India; Male; Meditation; Memory, Short-Term; Neuropsychological Tests; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082977160

Subjects in a mindfulness meditation experimental group were compared to a waitlist control group. Subjects in the mindfulness meditation experimental group spent four weeks training and practicing mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness was measured before and after training using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). Episodic memory was measured before and after training using a source recognition task. During the retrieval phase of the source recognition task, EEG was recorded. The results showed that mindfulness, source recognition behavioral performance, and EEG theta power in right frontal and left parietal channels increased following mindfulness meditation training. In addition, increases in mindfulness correlated with increases in theta power in right frontal channels.

Non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue alleviation in older adults have not been reviewed and meta-analysed. Objective: To evaluate the immediate and long-term effects of non-pharmacological interventions on fatigue in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Randomised controlled trials published from 2008 to May 2018 were searched in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science databases. The reference lists of the publications, forward citation and clinical trial registries were also reviewed. Relevant data were extracted and meta-analysis was conducted using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3. Results: Eight studies, with a total of 1093 participants, were identified. Non-pharmacological interventions included mindfulness meditation, a behavioural lifestyle programme, muscle relaxation, pet insect-assisted therapy, yoga, Tai Chi and cognitive behavioural therapy. Non-pharmacological interventions elicited significant immediate positive effects on fatigue (SMD:-0.40, 95% CI-0.62 to-0.18), although there was no lasting effect. Both physical and cognitive/mental interventions effectively alleviated fatigue. Conclusion: Non-pharmacological interventions appear to be effective in alleviating fatigue at immediate post-intervention in community-dwelling older adults. More studies with robust designs and adequate sample sizes are needed in the future. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society.

This resulted in profound attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response elicited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Herein, we assessed whether this training program affects the plasma metabolome and if these changes are linked to the immunomodulatory effects observed. A total of 224 metabolites were identified in plasma obtained from 24 healthy male volunteers at six timepoints, of which 98 were significantly altered following LPS administration. Effects of the training program were most prominent shortly after initiation of the acquired breathing exercises but prior to LPS administration, and point towards increased activation of the Cori cycle. Elevated concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in trained individuals correlated with enhanced levels of anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-10. In vitro validation experiments revealed that co-incubation with lactate and pyruvate enhances IL-10 production and attenuates the release of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-6 by LPS-stimulated leukocytes. Our results demonstrate that practicing the breathing exercises acquired during the training program results in increased activity of the Cori cycle.

Despite substantial effort to advance our understanding of the etiology and potential treatment of neurodegeneration, there remains a paucity of information with respect to this complex disease process. Interestingly, stress has been implicated among the potential mechanisms implicated in neurodegenerative pathology. Given the increase in chronic stress in modern society, this premise warrants further investigation. The aim of this review is to evaluate the influence of stress on neurodegeneration, the effect of neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis on stress, and therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases with a special focus on stress reduction. Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's Disease showed an acceleration in disease progression and a worsening of symptoms under stress. Some therapies (e.g., yoga, meditation) focused on reducing stress showed beneficial effects against neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, more studies are necessary in order to completely understand the implications of stress in neurodegeneration and the usefulness of stress reduction in the treatment thereof. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Neurodegeneration; Neurodegenerative disease; Stress","alpha synuclein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; apolipoprotein E; arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase; brain derived neurotrophic factor; corticotropin releasing factor; corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydrocortisone; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor 2B; noradrenalin; nuclear receptor Nur77; peptides and proteins; reactive oxygen metabolite; RTP801 protein; transcription factor FKHRL1; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; acceleration; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; chronic stress; disease course; enzyme inhibition; frontotemporal dementia; gene expression; human; Huntington chorea; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; immunocompetent cell; mild cognitive impairment; multiple sclerosis; music therapy; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; Review; upregulation; complication; degenerative disease; meditation; mental stress; prevention and control; yoga; Humans; Meditation; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Stress, Psychological; Yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078432631

Thus, research into treatment has been minimal. Aim: Review the prevalence of SPA and its relation to sexual dysfunctions and anxiety disorders. Compare SPA to (non-sexual) performance anxiety and social anxiety (PA/SA). Apply pharmacologic principles to the known properties of drugs and phytotherapies to hypothesize treatments for SPA. Methods: Review SPA and PA/SA through PubMed searches for relevant literature from 2000 to 2018. Main Outcome Measure: Prevalence was estimated using population-representative surveys. For treatment results, controlled clinical trial results were prioritized over open-label trial results. Results: SPA affects 9–25% of men and contributes to premature ejaculation and psychogenic erectile dysfunction (ED). SPA affects 6–16% of women and severely inhibits sexual desire. Cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness meditation training have been proven effective for PA/SA and are recommended for SPA, but controlled studies are lacking. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are effective for psychogenic ED and premature ejaculation, both of which include SPA as a major element. Drugs proven for PA/SA have adverse sexual and sedative effects, but serotonergic anxiolytics with prosexual effects (buspirone ± testosterone, trazodone ± bupropion) may have potential, and sage, passionflower, L-theanine, and bitter orange are anxiolytic. Nitric oxide boosters (L-citrulline, L-arginine, Panax ginseng) have the potential for increasing genital tumescence and lubrication, and plant-based alpha-adrenergic antagonists may aid sexual arousal (yohimbine/yohimbe, Citrus aurantium/p-synephrine). Conclusion: SPA causes or maintains most common sexual dysfunction. No treatments are well proven, although cognitive behavior therapy, mindfulness meditation training, and serotonergic anxiolytics (buspirone, trazodone, gepirone) have potential, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are effective for psychogenic ED and premature ejaculation.

Aim: To evaluate and review the literature on body awareness and female sexual function. Methods: A literature review was conducted through PsycInfo, PsycARTICLES, and PubMed using terms such as body awareness and sexual function. A manual search also was conducted using reference lists. Main Outcome Measures: Studies were included if manipulated body awareness was a main variable of interest and if outcome variables included female sexual functioning or sexual response. Results: 29 studies were included in this review and grouped into 3 categories: sensate focus (n = 7), mindfulness (n = 13), and laboratory manipulations of body awareness (n = 9). Body awareness is identified as an area of importance for female sexuality. Explicit instructions aimed at increasing body awareness, including those used in the clinical techniques of sensate focus and mindfulness, appear to enhance sexual response for many women, including women with low sexual arousal, hypoactive desire, anorgasmia, and sexual pain and in non-clinical samples. Induction of implicit body awareness also resulted in increased arousal in 1 study. Conclusion: Body awareness appears to enhance sexual well-being for some women. This is supported by laboratory manipulation studies conducted on women with and without sexual difficulties and by intervention studies using sensate focus and mindfulness for women with a range of sexual problems. The extent to which enhanced body awareness accounts for results in intervention studies is often unclear because of other features of the interventions and/or study design. This review provides the field with a summary of intervention and laboratory studies on body awareness, with results pointing toward body awareness as an integral component of treatment for sexual dysfunction.

The available evidence from structural studies suggests that mediation impacts neuronal plasticity and the functional MRI suggest that there are changes in gray and white matter in subjects who meditate. FMRI studies show that meditation is associated with decreased activity of default mode network and activation of brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional control. Together, the available imaging techniques have revealed that rather than impacting specific brain regions, meditation causes structural and functional changes in large-scale brain networks. © 2020 Frontiers in Bioscience.

Design: Cross-sectional study consisting of an anonymous online survey sent to 2112 patients from eight centres in four countries in 2018. Patients were asked to identify research questions relevant to them in the field of infertility and ART. Answers were categorized into topics and ranked by frequency. A long list of the top 30 research topics was extracted from the aggregate results, from which a short list of the top 10 research topics was created. Ten research questions were finally formulated. Results: A total of 945 responses were analysed. Main interests were side-effects, success rates, infertility prevention and emotional support. The 10 research questions were: 1. What are the side-effects of drugs used in ART treatments? (51.6%). 2. What are the most effective methods to cope with infertility from the psychological point of view? (35.7%). 3. What effects could diet have on fertility? (25.9%). 4. What are ART success rates per clinical profile? (24.8%). 5. Are there some habits and lifestyle factors that could prevent infertility? (20.0%). 6. What are the long-term risks associated with ART in mother and child? (18.5%). 7. Are alternative therapies such as acupuncture, yoga and meditation effective to treat/prevent infertility? (18.5%). 8. What is the impact of exercise on fertility? (15.4%). 9. How does oocyte quantity and quality affect fertility? (9.5%). 10. What are the genetic patterns or hereditary conditions causing/related to infertility? (9.5%).

While the underlying biological mechanisms of TM are not yet fully explored, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis represents an index providing important clues embodying the stress system cascade. In this pilot study, young adults were randomly assigned to TM training followed by 8 weeks of meditation practice or a wait-list control condition. TM was conducted over 8 weeks. Thirty-four young adult participants were randomized; 27 participants completed the HPA outcome assessments (41% male). To assess HPA axis functioning, salivary samples to assess cortisol awakening response (CAR) that were collected in the morning, both at baseline and at week-4. Salivary cortisol in the context of a social stressor using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was collected at week-8. The results indicate that participants who were randomly assigned to TM had lower awakening salivary cortisol levels and a greater drop in CAR from baseline to week-4 than the control group. There were no significant differences in HPA axis functioning in the context of the TSST. Primary limitations of this randomized controlled trial were the small sample size, the use of a wait-list as opposed to an active control, and the limited scope of HPA axis assessments. The results of this pilot study provide tentative evidence that TM may impact biological stress system functioning and suggests that this may be a worthwhile avenue to continue to examine. It will also be useful to extend these findings to a broader array of meditative and mindful practices, particularly for those who are experiencing more distress. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","awakening; cortisol; HPA axis; meditation; mind-body; Transcendental","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; adult; Article; brain function; clinical article; college student; controlled study; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; drug dependence; exercise test; female; generalized anxiety disorder; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; male; Minnesota; outcome assessment; pilot study; prediction; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; relaxation training; saliva level; self report; subjective wellbeing of life scale; transcendental meditation; treatment duration; treatment response; trier social stress test; young adult; anxiety; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; meditation; mental stress; mindfulness; pathophysiology; psychology; saliva; therapy; Anxiety; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Meditation; Mindfulness; Pilot Projects; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073997676

Stress and mental illnesses adversely affect glycemic control. In most patients, a multidisciplinary approach including physical activity, healthy diet, and stress management is required for glycemic control. Mindfulness‑based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that reduces emotional distress through self‑awareness and assuming the responsibility for individual choices, and results in increased effective health behaviors. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of mindfulness meditation on glycemic control and mental health in patients with type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study was performed in 2018 in Isfahan city. A total number of 108 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 were selected and allocated randomly to two groups, intervention (12 weeks MBSR program) and control (routine care). Depression, anxiety, and stress scores regarding to depression, anxiety, and stress Scale - 21 questionnaire and also amounts of fasting blood sugar (FBS) and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were assessed and analyzed using independent t-test, paired t-test, Mann–Whitney U-test, and Chi‑square, before and 13 weeks after educational programs. Results: The means of HbA1C, FBS, and depression, anxiety, and stress scores improved significantly after intervention in the MBSR group. Except FBS levels, all outcome variable scores’ mean change was significant between the two groups. Conclusions: In general, this study revealed that mindfulness meditation could be helpful in improving the quality of mental health and lowering glycemic control indices in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. © 2022 Advanced Biomedical Research | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149271917

Stress due to Tension Type Headache (TTH) is a another epidemic which is growing with a very fast pace. Diabetes is a disease of the body which does not cause metabolism of blood sugar (glucose). This increases the blood glucose to the risky level. The present study aims to analyze diabetes with the latest IoT and Big Data analysis techniques and its correlation with stress (TTH) on human health. Authors have tried to include age, gender, and insulin factor and its correlation with diabetes. IoT helps us to connect each other, i.e., it is known as smart connecting thing (a sort of “Universal Global Neural Network” in cloud). It comprises of smart connecting machine with other machine, object, and a lot more. Big Data refers to huge sets of data which are also large enough in terms of variety and velocity. Due to this, it becomes more difficult to handle, organize, store, process, and manipulate such data using traditional techniques of storage and processing. Stress especially TTH is a serious problem in today’s world. Now every person in this world is facing headache and stress-related problems in daily life. We have collected this Big Data and studied the people we have studied their tension level and helped them to cure it. In this chapter, we did our best to analyze the correlation between diabetes and stressors. For the analysis, we have been collected sample of 30 subjects from hospitals of Delhi in random fashion who has been suffering from diabetes from their Health Insurance Providers without disclosing any Personal Information (PI) or Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) by Law. To identify each case sample ids like S1, S2, etc., have been allotted to the subjects. Sample Data has been collected for following parameters: gender, age, diabetes type, insulin dependency, obesity status, coronary artery disease status, and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy status. We have used the Tableau s/w for this analysis. Overall, interesting observation during our research was that none of our female subject having diabetes is below 25 years, i.e., early age diabetes cases were very less in females comparative to males subjected to the case sampling should not be impacted for age group gender biasing. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

On the basis of Pathophysiology of cell senescence and of chronic degenerative diseases, possible preventive/therapeutic pathways have been examined. Chronic low grade cellular inflammation and chronic stress have been shown as the general interlinked factors inducing aging, on the basis of complex biochemical, cell and multi-organ derangements. The main cell degenerative processes which have been related to aging are: altered mitochondria DNA/metabolism, excessive oxidative stress, glycation, alteration of autophagy and proteasome, and genome alterations. Literature about longevity-targeting interventions, beyond conventional medicine, describes a spectrum of possible measures to improve psycho-biological resilience, based on the PNEI paradigm, on hormesis and upon mitochondriatargeted interventions.

Complementary strategies, such as meditation, can accompany pharmacologic therapy to improve symptoms. Although support programs with targeted content have wider reach, higher adherence, and greater impact, there are no consumer-based meditation apps designed specifically for cancer. Objective: This study aimed to gather information to advise the development of a cancer-specific meditation app in a small convenience sample of cancer patients and survivors who currently use the Calm app. Methods: Adult cancer patients and survivors who are Calm users (N=82) were recruited through the Daily Calm Facebook page. Participants completed a Web-based survey related to Calm app use and satisfaction, interest in and ideas for a cancer-specific Calm app, and demographic characteristics. Open-ended responses were inductively coded. Results: Participants were aged between 18 and 72 years (mean 48.60 years, SD 15.20), mostly female (77/82, 94%), white (65/79, 82%), and non-Hispanic (70/75, 93%), and reported using Calm at least 5 times per week (49/82, 60%). Although rates of satisfaction with current Calm components were high (between 65/82, 79% and 51/81, 63%), only 49% (40/82) of participants used guided meditations that they felt specifically helped with their cancer-related symptoms and survivorship, and 40% (33/82) would prefer more cancer-related content, with guided meditations for cancer-specific anxieties (eg, fear of recurrence; n=15) and coping with strong emotions (n=12) being the most common suggestions. A majority of participants (51/82, 62%) reported that they would be interested in becoming a member of a Calm cancer community (eg, in-app discussion boards: 41/46, 89%; and social media communities: 35/42, 83%). Almost half of the participants (37/82, 45%) reported that they would benefit from features that tracked symptoms in concurrence with app usage, but respondents were divided on whether this information should be shared with health care providers through the app (49/82, 60% would share). Conclusions: Responses suggest ways in which the current Calm app could be adapted to better fit cancer patients’ and survivors’ needs and preferences, including adding cancer-specific content, increasing the amount of content focusing on coping with strong emotions, developing communities for Calm users who are cancer patients and survivors, and including features that track cancer-related symptoms. Given differences in opinions about which features were desirable or would be useful, there is a clear need for future cancer-specific apps to be customizable (eg, ability to turn different features on or off). Although future research should address these topics in larger, more diverse samples, these data will serve as a starting point for the development of cancer-specific meditation apps and provide a framework for evaluating their effects. ©Jennifer Huberty, Megan Puzia, Ryan Eckert, Linda Larkey.","Cancer; Cancer survivors; Consumer behavior; Health; Meditation; Mental health; Mindfulness; Mobile apps","adult; aged; anxiety; article; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; cancer survivor; consumer attitude; controlled study; convenience sample; demography; female; health care personnel; human; human tissue; major clinical study; meditation; mental health; mindfulness; mobile application; perception; satisfaction; social media; survivorship; tumor-related gene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097539921

The aim of this article is to present a short review of noninvasive, nonpharmacological treatment methods used in somatic illnesses that fall under the umbrella of approach called behavioral medicine. Methods. The narrative review method was applied in the study. Science paper databases, including PubMed, had been used to retrieve papers on therapeutic methods used in clinical setting that meet the broad criteria of behavioral medicine definition as stated in the Charter of International Behavioral Medicine Society Results. Main groups of methods, disorders in which they are being employed and their effectiveness, have been identified. Conclusions. Behavioral medicine is grouping treatment methods and interventions that hold large potential for clinical setting. Two groups of methods can be distinguished by the scrutiny and level of evidence gathered in their effectiveness assessment; for biofeedback, guided imagery, and hypnosis techniques, comprehensive evidence reports in the framework of U.S. Evidence Synthesis Program exist. Meditation techniques, disclosure therapies, and relaxation methods are less well assessed. Broader employment of behavioral medicine therapies in clinical setting is possible after addressing two major problems in the field, which are deficiencies in quality evidence of effectiveness for many of the methods and their insufficiencies in underlying therapeutic mechanism knowledge. © 2020 Joanna Białkowska et al.",,"behavioral medicine; biofeedback; controlled study; employment; guided imagery; hypnosis; meditation; Medline; narrative; relaxation training; review; synthesis; behavioral medicine; biofeedback; electromyography; human; meditation; mindfulness; neurofeedback; procedures; Behavioral Medicine; Biofeedback, Psychology; Electromyography; Humans; Hypnosis; Imagery, Psychotherapy; Meditation; Mindfulness; Neurofeedback; Relaxation Therapy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096324652

Despite recent interest, relatively few studies have empirically examined equanimity and measurement instruments are still lacking. The main goal of this study was to develop an Equanimity Scale (the EQUA-S) in a Western population with or without meditation experience, based on previous definitions of equanimity, in order to investigate its relations with the relevant psychological constructs and health outcomes. Methods: Adults from the general population (N = 265; Mage = 34.81) completed various measures: the EQUA-S, mindfulness, hyper-sensitivity, avoidance and fusion, impulsivity, personality, alexithymia, sensitivity to punishment and reward and frequency of problematic addictive behaviors. The dimensionality of the EQUA-S was examined using Factor Analyses. The convergent validity of this new scale was investigated using Pearson’s Correlations. Results: The results of a factor analysis revealed two dimensions of equanimity: an even-minded state of mind (E-MSM) and a hedonic independence (HI) component. While the E-MSM was positively related to emotional stability, adaptive emotional regulation and several mindfulness-related abilities, HI was found to correlate negatively with addictive issues. Discussion: The relations with personality constructs and possible related cognitive processes are discussed.

Stress reactivity can be different in women compared to men, which might consequently influence disease risk. Stress in women may also generate adverse physiological effects on their offspring during pregnancy or lactation. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of different relaxation interventions on physiological outcomes and perceived relaxation in healthy young women, to assist in identifying the most appropriate intervention(s) for use in a subsequent trial for mothers who deliver prematurely. Methods. A within-subject study was conducted in 17 women of reproductive age comparing five different relaxation interventions (guided-imagery meditation audio (GIM), music listening (ML), relaxation lighting (RL), GIM+RL, ML+RL), with control (silence/sitting), assigned in random order over a 3–6 week period. Subjective feelings of relaxation (10-point scale), heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), and fingertip temperature (FT) were measured before and after each technique Results. All interventions significantly increased perceived relaxation and FT, while music also significantly reduced SBP (p &lt; 0.05). Compared to control, HR significantly decreased following GIM (mean difference = 3.2 bpm, p &lt; 0.05), and FT increased (mean difference = 2.2 ◦C, p &lt; 0.05) and SBP decreased (mean difference = 3.3 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01) following ML. GIM + RL followed by GIM were the most preferred interventions. Conclusions. Based on preference, simplicity, and the physiological and psychological effects, GIM and ML were identified as the most effective tools for reducing stress and improving relaxation. These techniques warrant further research in larger samples and other populations.

The child version is a structured group psychotherapy developed to help children aged 8–13 years manage anxiety. MBCT-C engages children in short, experiential group activities; offering interactive, age-appropriate mindfulness practices in child-friendly language. Hands-on activities and creative repetition promote learning. Activities include breath meditations, still and movement-based body awareness practices, and sensory-based activities (i.e., mindful seeing, touching, tasting, smelling, and hearing). One to two therapists lead groups of six to eight children in 12 weekly, 90-min sessions. Like the adult MBCT program, children are expected to practice at home between sessions. Parents or caregivers are invited to participate in two separate sessions and in the child’s home practices. The main goals of MBCT-C are as follows:To enhance social-emotional resiliency in a safe group environment.To learn to distinguish thoughts that are judgmental from those that simply describe or note one’s experiences.To recognize that judgments often escalate mood disturbances, which can then trigger maladaptive behaviors.To promote positive changes in how the child relates to his or her own thoughts, and emotions, and body sensations.To cultivate self-acceptance and acceptance of those things that cannot be changed.To expand awareness of personal emotional and behavioral choices. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acceptance; Anxiety; Awareness; Children; Depression; Group therapy; MBCT; MBCT-C; Meditation; Mindfulness","age distribution; anxiety; awareness; clinical practice; cognitive therapy; depression; group therapy; hearing; human; maladjustment; meditation; mindfulness; mood disorder; priority journal; psychological resilience; smelling; social acceptance; taste; touch; vision",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088444588

This study's objective was to evaluate the self-reported use and perceived effectiveness of CAM in adults and children with IEM. Methods: Patients aged 0-70 years and caregivers seen at the London Health Sciences Centre Metabolic Clinic (London, Ontario, Canada) between July 2017 and August 2017 were recruited to complete a questionnaire regarding CAM use to help their IEM diagnosis and perceived effectiveness of these therapies. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics; age, sex, and education level associations among CAM users were tested using the Pearson χ2 test. Results: Of 50 potential participants, 44 (88%) completed the questionnaire, including 21 adults (6 by caregivers) and 23 children (22 by caregivers). The most common IEM category was Aminoacidopathies and Small Molecule Disorders (50%). Twenty-seven (61%) participants reported CAM use to help their IEM diagnosis. The most common CAM therapies used were chiropractic manipulation, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and aromatherapy/essential oils. Most CAM users and caregivers (74%) perceived their CAM therapies as effective overall. Among CAM users, 40% had not discussed CAM use with a health care professional (HCP). CAM use was similar when comparing age, sex and education level. Conclusions: CAM is commonly used among patients with IEM. The safety and efficacy of CAM therapies for IEM should be further investigated. HCPs and patients should openly discuss CAM use in order to evaluate safety. © 2019 The Authors.

One of the natural features is the hot springs in Saudi Arabia, where people travel around the globe to have such experience and treatment in hot springs. Thus, this work presents the development of Hot Spring Healing Meditation Center at Saudi Arabia. In this work, four case studies were analysed. Based on the analysed case studies, for the meditation center, the estimated gross floor area is 8891 m2. In addition, the center is comprised of few zones, which are meditation, naturopathy, wellness and accommodation. Moreover, for this work, two sites were proposed for developing the meditation center. Both sites were subjected to site evaluation analysis in order to determine the most suitable site. The results of the site evaluation analysis showed that site 1 exhibited the highest score of 113 and was selected as the development site. In terms of architecture, the design concept of this meditation center is based on the biophilic design of incorporating the natural environment and the center. The meditation center is expected to be the main attraction for meditation and hot spring healing centers in the region and it will contribute to the economy of Saudi Arabia in terms of tourism. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.","Center; Hot spring; Meditation; Saudi Arabia",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085937304

These include the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia, as well as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Although the afferent and efferent pathways linking the gut and the brain are modulated by stress, the fields of neurogastroenterology and psychoneuroendocrinology (PNE)/ psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) remain only loosely connected. We aim to contribute to bringing these fields closer together by drawing attention to a fascinating, evolving research area, targeting an audience with a strong interest in the role of stress in health and disease. To this end, this review introduces the concept of the brain-gut axis and its major pathways, and provides a brief introduction to epidemiological and clinical aspects of FGIDs and IBD. From an interdisciplinary PNE/PNI perspective, we then detail current knowledge regarding the role of chronic and acute stress in the pathophysiology of FGID and IBD.

Evidence has demonstrated an improvement in sleep problems in patients with cancer through the use of mind-body medicine (MBM). In the current study, the authors sought to elucidate the prevalence of sleep problems and the use of MBM in adult cancer survivors. Methods: The authors analyzed data from the 2017 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to estimate the prevalence of sleep problems and use of MBM in adult cancer survivors using means, standard deviations, weighted frequencies, and distributions. Backward stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of MBM use within the past 12 months: age, sex, ethnicity, region, educational level, employment, and time since cancer diagnosis. Results: A weighted total of 13,750,028 cancer survivors (59.2%) reported sleep problems. For the most part, survivors with sleep problems were aged ≥40 years, female, and non-Hispanic white. More survivors with (weighted N = 3,794,493; 27.6%) compared with without (weighted N = 1,695,435; 17.9%) sleep problems used MBM. Among cancer survivors with sleep problems, the most commonly used mind-body practice was spiritual meditation (weighted N = 1,972,578; 14.3%), followed by yoga (weighted N = 1,695,553; 17.9%). The use of MBM was independently predicted by being female, living in the western United States, having a higher educational level, and being employed. Conclusions: The high prevalence of sleep problems in cancer survivors is a major health issue that needs to be addressed. A considerable number of cancer survivors with sleep problems use MBM. This finding warrants the investigation of MBM concepts as treatment options for cancer survivors experiencing sleep problems. © 2019 American Cancer Society","cancer; insomnia; meditation; mind-body medicine; sleep problems","adult; age; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer survivor; controlled study; decision making; educational status; ethnicity; experience; female; human; male; malignant neoplasm; medicine; meditation; middle aged; mind body medicine; prevalence; priority journal; sex; sleep disorder; sleep time; United States; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073825142

However, the world record holder of full-body ice immersion has repeatedly demonstrated an extraordinary tolerance to extreme cold. We aimed to explore thermoregulatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular responses during 88 min of full-body ice immersion. We continuously measured gastrointestinal temperature (Tgi), skin temperature (Tskin), blood pressure, and heart rate (HR). Oxygen consumption (VO2) was measured at rest, and after 45 and 88 min of ice immersion, in order to calculate the metabolic heat production. Tskin dropped significantly (28–34°C to 4–15°C) and VO2 doubled (5.7–11.3 ml kg−1 min−1), whereas Tgi (37.6°C), HR (72 bpm), and mean arterial pressure (106 mmHg) remained stable during the first 30 min of cold exposure. During the remaining of the trial, Tskin and VO2 remained stable, while Tgi gradually declined to 37.0°C and HR and mean arterial blood pressure increased to maximum values of 101 bpm and 115 mmHg, respectively. Metabolic heat production in rest was 169 W and increased to 321 W and 314 W after 45 and 80 min of ice immersion. Eighty-eight minutes of full-body ice immersion resulted in minor changes of Tgi and cardiovascular responses, while Tskin and VO2 changed markedly. These findings may suggest that our participant can optimize his thermoregulatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular responses to challenge extreme cold exposure. © 2019 The Authors.

Furthermore, slow learning, incremental adaptation, and false convergence are unresolved challenges for ANNs. In this article we, therefore, introduce Gaussian synapses based on heterostructures of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, namely molybdenum disulfide and black phosphorus field effect transistors (FETs), as a class of analog and probabilistic computational primitives for hardware implementation of statistical neural networks. We also demonstrate complete tunability of amplitude, mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian synapse via threshold engineering in dual gated molybdenum disulfide and black phosphorus FETs.

One might expect that in order to protect their scientific authority and objectivity, scientists who study meditation would try to distance themselves from meditation practitioners; however, a personal practice of meditation was not only accepted among scientists who study meditation, but it was also encouraged. Interviews with thirty scientists who study meditation revealed that this overlap could be explained by a new category of internal boundary practices that facilitated this collaboration: embodied practitioner knowledge. Whereas external boundary practices enable people on either sides of a boundary to work together, internal boundary practices are critical for understanding how individuals who occupy liminal spaces between disparate groups use their own bodies to support the crossing of boundaries. Scientists who both researched and practiced mediation reported that their meditation practice enabled them to translate between two domains that are epistemologically distinct, thus forging new pathways and areas of research. Moreover, meditation practice strengthens authoritative claims for objective knowledge. Embodied practitioner knowledge complements (and is supported by) other boundary practices such as standardized packages, boundary objects, and boundary organizations. © 2018, © 2018 Process Press.","Boundary practices; embodied practitioner knowledge; mindfulness meditation; subjective experience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059297866

Here, we probed the distinct effects on telomere length (TL) of mindfulness meditation (MM) and loving-kindness meditation (LKM). Midlife adults (N = 142) were randomized to be in a waitlist control condition or to learn either MM or LKM in a 6-week workshop. Telomere length was assessed 2 weeks before the start of the workshops and 3 weeks after their termination. After controlling for appropriate demographic covariates and baseline TL, we found TL decreased significantly in the MM group and the control group, but not in the LKM group. There was also significantly less TL attrition in the LKM group than the control group. The MM group showed changes in TL that were intermediate between the LKM and control groups yet not significantly different from either. Self-reported emotions and practice intensity (duration and frequency) did not mediate these observed group differences. This study is the first to disentangle the effects of LKM and MM on TL and suggests that LKM may buffer telomere attrition. © 2019","Cell aging; Compassion meditation; Contemplative science; Metta; Positive psychology","adult; aging; Article; controlled study; correlational study; emotion; evidence based practice; female; human; intervention study; loving kindness meditation; male; meditation; mindfulness; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; self report; sensitivity analysis; telomere length; aging; meditation; middle aged; physiology; procedures; psychology; telomere; telomere homeostasis; Adult; Aging; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Telomere; Telomere Homeostasis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066851262

Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of the kinase domain of receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIP1), has been reported to regulate renal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, its underlying mechanism of action remains unclear. HK-2 cells were used to create an in vitro I/R model, in which the cells were subjected to hypoxia, followed by 2, 6, and 12 h of reoxygenation. For the in vivo study, a rat model of renal I/R was established in which samples of rat blood serum and kidney tissue were harvested after reperfusion to assess renal function and detect histological changes. Cell viability and necroptosis were analyzed using the Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expression levels of molecules associated with necroptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation were determined by real-time PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and ELISA. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to confirm the relevant downstream signaling pathway. We found that pretreatment with Nec-1 significantly decreased hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and miR-26a expression, as well as the levels of factors associated with necroptosis (RIP1, RIP3, and Sirtuin-2), oxidative stress (malondialdehyde [MDA], NADP+/NADPH ratio), and inflammation (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α]) in I/R injury cells and the rat model. However, these effects could be reversed by miR-26a overexpression or TRPC6 knockdown. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that HIF-1α directly binds to the promoter region of miR-26a, and that TRPC6 is a potential target gene for miR-26a. Our findings indicate that Nec-1 can effectively protect against renal I/R injury by inhibiting necroptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, and may exert its effects through mediation of the HIF-1α/miR-26a/TRPC6/PARP1 signaling pathway. © 2019 The Author(s)","HIF-1α; inflammation; ischemic/reperfusion injury; miR-26a; Nec-1; necroptosis; oxidative stress; TRPC6","hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; malonaldehyde; microRNA 26a; necrostatin 1; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; protein kinase; protein kinase inhibitor; receptor interacting protein kinase 1; receptor interacting protein kinase 3; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; sirtuin; sirtuin 2; transient receptor potential channel 6; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; acute kidney failure; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell hypoxia; cell viability; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; flow cytometry; gene; gene expression; gene overexpression; HIF 1alpha/mir 26a/TRPC6/PARP1 signaling; histology; histopathology; HK-2 [Human kidney] cell line; human; human cell; immunofluorescence; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; kidney function; kidney tissue; luciferase assay; male; necroptosis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; renal ischemia reperfusion injury; reoxygenation; signal transduction; trpc6 gene; upregulation; Western blotting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070556402

Differences in the effects of induction techniques are being increasingly investigated. (2) Methods: Here, we compared changes in the individual experience of time, space, and self in 44 students in an integrative health-promotion program. They participated in a study employing mindfulness meditation and a relaxation intervention with one week between sessions, thus employing a within-subjects design. (3) Results: No significant differences were detected when subjective reports were compared directly after each intervention. However, we found significant sequence effects between t1 and t2, independent of the meditation type. The sense of self diminished, the present orientation increased, and the past and future orientations decreased in both interventions.

In the study, the crucial role of lncRNA cancer susceptibility candidate 9 (CASC9) in regulating cervical cancer metastasis and progression was investigated. CASC9 expression was markedly increased in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Cervical cancer patients with low CASC9 expression showed better overall survival rate. Moreover, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) could increase CASC9 expression. The crosslink between CAFs and cervical cancer cells led to CASC9 to elevate the metastasis of cervical cancer cells. CASC9 dysregulation could function as a miRNA sponge to competitively protect twist homolog 2 (TWIST2) mRNA 3′UTR from miR-215. Results in this study indicated the effects of CASC9 on cervical cancer and suggested a novel axis by which CASC9 meditated cervical cancer cell metastasis and proliferation both in vivo and in vitro.

Recent diffusion tensor imaging studies have examined the relationship of such factors with WM microstructure. This review summarizes the evidence regarding the relationship between WM microstructure and recognized modifiable factors, including hearing loss, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, smoking, depressive symptoms, physical (in) activity, and social isolation, as well as sleep disturbances, diet, cognitive training, and meditation. Current cross-sectional evidence suggests a clear link between loss of WM integrity (lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity) and hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking; a relationship that seems to hold for hearing loss, social isolation, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances. Physical activity, cognitive training, diet, and meditation, on the other hand, may protect WM with aging. Preliminary evidence from cross-sectional studies of treated risk factors suggests that modification of factors could slow down negative effects on WM microstructure.

Acupressure and meditation have been shown to control such symptoms. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an integrative medicine app to educate patients about these self-care tools in chemotherapy waiting rooms. Methods: We screened and enrolled cancer patients in chemotherapy waiting rooms at two Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center locations. Patients were randomly assigned into an intervention arm in which subjects watched acupressure and meditation instructional videos or a control arm in which they watched a time- and attention-matched integrative oncology lecture video. Before and after watching the videos, we asked the patients to rate four key symptoms: Stress, anxiety, nausea, and pain. We performed the analysis of covariance to detect differences between the two arms postintervention while controlling for baseline symptoms. Results: A total of 223 patients were enrolled in the study: 113 patients were enrolled in the intervention arm and 110 patients were enrolled in the control arm. In both groups, patients showed significant reductions in stress and anxiety from baseline (all P<.05), with the treatment arm reporting greater stress and anxiety reduction than the control arm (1.64 vs 1.15 in stress reduction; P=.01 and 1.39 vs 0.78 in anxiety reduction; P=.002). The majority of patients reported that the videos helped them pass time and that they would watch the videos again. Conclusions: An integrative medicine self-care app in the waiting room improved patients' experiences and reduced anxiety and stress. Future research could focus on expanding this platform to other settings to improve patients' overall treatment experiences. © 2021 JMIR Cancer.

Mindfulness meditation is a complementary therapy shown to be beneficial for alleviating a range of cancer-related symptoms; however, in-person meditation interventions are difficult for cancer patients to attend. Meditation via a mobile phone app represents a novel approach in MPN patients for delivering meditation. Objective: The study aimed to report MPN patients' (ie, naïve or nearly naïve meditators) perceptions of meditation and explore their experiences in the context of using a mobile phone for meditation after participation in an 8-week consumer-based meditation app feasibility study. Methods: MPN patients (n=128) were recruited nationally through organizational partners and social media. Eligible and consented patients were enrolled into 1 of 4 groups, 2 that received varying orders of 2 consumer-based apps (10% Happier and Calm) and 2 that received one of the apps alone for the second 4 weeks of the 8-week intervention after an educational control condition. Participants were asked to perform 10 min per day of mobile phone-based meditation, irrespective of the app and order in which they received the apps. At the conclusion of the study, participants were asked whether they would like to participate in a 20-min phone interview comprising 9 to 10 questions to discuss their perceptions and experiences while using the mobile phone meditation apps. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and imported into NVivo 12 (QSR International) for coding and analysis, using a combination of deductive and inductive methods to organize the data, generate categories, and develop themes and subthemes. Results: A total of 48 MPN patients completed postintervention interviews, of which 29% (14/48) of the patients only used the 10% Happier app, 21% (10/48) of the patients only used the Calm app, and 46% (22/48) of the patients used both apps during the 8-week intervention. Themes identified in the analysis of interview data related to (1) perceptions of meditation before, during, and after the study, (2) perceptions of the Calm app, (3) perceptions of the 10% Happier app, (4) perceived impacts of using the meditation apps, (5) overall experiences of participating in the study, (6) recommendations surrounding meditation for other MPN patients, and (7) plans to continue meditation. Conclusions: The qualitative findings of this study suggest that MPN patients who are naïve or nearly naïve meditators perceived mobile phone meditation as enjoyable, preferred the Calm app over the 10% Happier app, perceived the Calm app as more appealing (eg, narrator's voice and different meditations or background sounds offered), and perceived beneficial effects of meditation on mental health, sleep, fatigue, and pain. Future research is needed to better understand the efficacy of mobile phone meditation on MPN patient outcomes and meditation app design features that enhance uptake among its users. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc..

There are several major types of functional lncRNAs which participate in some important cellular pathways. LncRNA-RNA interaction controls mRNA translation and degradation or serves as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge for silencing. LncRNA-protein interaction regulates protein activity in transcriptional activation and silencing. LncRNA guide, decoy, and scaffold regulate transcription regulators of enhancer or repressor region of the coding genes for alteration of expression. LncRNA plays a role in cellular responses including the following activities: regulation of chromatin structural modification and gene expression for epigenetic and cell function control, promotion of hematopoiesis and maturation of immunity, cell programming in stem cell and somatic cell development, modulation of pathogen infection, switching glycolysis and lipid metabolism, and initiation of autoimmune diseases. LncRNA, together with miRNA, are considered the critical elements in cancer development. It has been demonstrated that tumorigenesis could be driven by homeostatic imbalance of lncRNA/miRNA/cancer regulatory factors resulting in biochemical and physiological alterations inside the cells. Cancer-driven lncRNAs with other cellular RNAs, epigenetic modulators, or protein effectors may change gene expression level and affect the viability, immortality, and motility of the cells that facilitate cancer cell cycle rearrangement, angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis. Molecular medicine will be the future trend for development. LncRNA/miRNA could be one of the potential candidates in this category. Continuous studies in lncRNA functional discrepancy between cancer cells and normal cells and regional and rational genetic differences of lncRNA profiles are critical for clinical research which is beneficial for clinical practice. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Epigenetic alteration; lncRNA; Metastasis; Microbiota meditation; miRNA; Targeted therapy design; Tumor proliferation","Clinical research; Cytology; Disease control; Diseases; Gene expression regulation; Nucleic acids; Pathology; Proteins; Stem cells; Transcription; Epigenetic alterations; lncRNA; Metastasis; Microbiotas; miRNA; Therapy design; Tumor proliferation; RNA; growth factor; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; protein p53; RNA; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; transcriptome; biota; cancer; degradation; gene expression; methodology; microbial activity; microorganism; mutation; protein; RNA; tumor; biogenesis; biosynthesis; cancer growth; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; chromatin; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; disease association; enhancer region; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; hematopoiesis; human; immune system; infectious agent; innate immunity; lifespan; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; metabolic regulation; metastasis; microflora; nerve cell; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; regulatory mechanism; Review; somatic cell; stem cell; stomach cancer; transcription initiation; tumor suppressor gene; animal; biology; colorectal tumor; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; liver tumor; molecularly targeted therapy; mouse; stomach tumor; Animals; Colorectal Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; MicroRNAs; Molecular Targeted Therapy; RNA, Long Noncoding; Stomach Neoplasms; Transcriptome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065311714

Symptom control continues to be a challenging therapeutic goal despite available pharmacologic interventions. The goal of this review is to detail recent efforts that have focused on non-pharmacologic interventions, such as wholistic or integrative medicine, as an adjunctive method to alter symptom burden in this population. Recent Findings: We discuss the ongoing physical, nutritional, and psychological interventional efforts which represent promising non-traditional interventions to date to help reduce symptom in MPN patients. In this article, we highlight the early promising data and importance of these various non-pharmacological interventions to dampen symptom burden and reduce disease-related inflammation.

The authors reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga conducted at these points in the cancer continuum (N = 29; n = 13 during treatment, n = 12 post-treatment, and n = 4 with mixed samples). Findings both during and after treatment demonstrated the efficacy of yoga to improve overall quality of life (QOL), with improvement in subdomains of QOL varying across studies. Fatigue was the most commonly measured outcome, and most RCTs conducted during or after cancer treatment reported improvements in fatigue. Results also suggested that yoga can improve stress/distress during treatment and post-treatment disturbances in sleep and cognition. Several RCTs provided evidence that yoga may improve biomarkers of stress, inflammation, and immune function. Outcomes with limited or mixed findings (eg, anxiety, depression, pain, cancer-specific symptoms, such as lymphedema) and positive psychological outcomes (such as benefit-finding and life satisfaction) warrant further study. Important future directions for yoga research in oncology include: enrolling participants with cancer types other than breast, standardizing self-report assessments, increasing the use of active control groups and objective measures, and addressing the heterogeneity of yoga interventions, which vary in type, key components (movement, meditation, breathing), dose, and delivery mode. © 2019 American Cancer Society","anxiety; cancer; depression; fatigue; mind-body; quality of life; sleep; symptoms; yoga","anxiety; breast cancer; breathing; cancer pain; cancer survivor; cognition; controlled study; depression; distress syndrome; evidence based medicine; fatigue; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; inflammation; life satisfaction; lymphedema; meditation; muscle weakness; oncology; outcome assessment; priority journal; psychological aspect; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; Review; self report; sleep; stress; symptomatology; vertigo; yoga; disease management; neoplasm; prognosis; psychology; quality of life; Cancer Survivors; Disease Management; Humans; Neoplasms; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063668961

GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework was used and a professional librarian performed the literature search. The expert committee included the President of the CVSA who brought a patient perspective into the deliberations. The committee makes recommendations for the prophylaxis of CVS, treatment of acute attacks, diagnosis, and overall management of CVS. The committee strongly recommends that adults with moderate-to-severe CVS receive a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), such as amitriptyline, as a first-line prophylactic medication and receive topiramate or aprepitant as alternate prophylactic medications. Zonisamide or levetiracetam and mitochondrial supplements (Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, and riboflavin) are conditionally recommended as alternate prophylactic medications, either alone or concurrently with other prophylactic medications. For acute attacks, the committee conditionally recommends using serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, and/or triptans, such as sumatriptan or aprepitant to abort symptoms. Emergency department treatment is best achieved with the use of an individualized treatment protocol and shared with the care team (example provided). The committee recommended screening and treatment for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, migraine headache, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and substance use with referral to appropriate allied health services as indicated. Techniques like meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback may be offered as complementary therapy to improve overall well-being and patient care outcomes. © 2019 The Authors.

Methods: We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and focused on interventions aimed at prophylactic management and abortive treatment of adults with CVS. Specifically, this evidence review addresses the following clinical questions: (a) Should the following pharmacologic agents be used for prophylaxis of CVS: amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant, zonisamide/levetiracetam, or mitochondrial supplements? (b) Should the following pharmacologic agents be used for abortive treatment: triptans or aprepitant?. Results: We found very low-quality evidence to support the use of the following agents for prophylactic and abortive treatment of CVS: amitriptyline, topiramate, aprepitant, zonisamide/levetiracetam, and mitochondrial supplements. We have moderate certainty of evidence for the use of triptans as abortive therapy. We found limited evidence to support the use of ondansetron and the treatment of co-morbid conditions and complementary therapies. Conclusions: This evidence review helps inform the accompanying guideline for the management of adults with CVS which is aimed at helping clinicians, patients, and policymakers, and should improve patient outcomes. © 2019 The Authors.

However, little is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying this relationship. This study compares the physiological stress response (reactivity and recovery) measured by changes in salivary cortisol, heart rate, heart rate variability, and the associated stress-related ratings in long-term meditation practitioners (N = 29) and age- and sex- matched meditation naïve controls (N = 26). The participants were administered the Trier Social Stress Test in its active and placebo versions. The results demonstrated that long-term meditation practitioners had faster cortisol recovery from stress, and experienced less shame and higher self-esteem after the exposure to social-evaluative threat. In addition, long-term meditation practitioners scored higher on adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies, such as acceptance and positive reappraisal, and lower on maladaptive ones, such as catastrophizing. The cognitive emotion regulation strategy of acceptance mediated the relationship between meditation practice and cortisol recovery. These results suggest that meditation practice is associated with faster recovery from stress due to the employment of adaptive emotion regulation strategy of acceptance, delineating a pathway underlying the positive effects of meditation on stress. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive appraisals; Contemplative practices; Emotion regulation; Self-conscious emotions; Stress; TSST","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; Article; autoregulation; catastrophizing; cognition; controlled study; emotion; emotionality; employment; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; hydrocortisone blood level; long term care; male; meditation; physician; priority journal; psychological aspect; self concept; self esteem; stress; adult; affect; anxiety; chemistry; mental stress; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; procedures; psychology; saliva; therapy; Adult; Affect; Anxiety; Emotional Regulation; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Saliva; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062388135

Our study sought to evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation interventions on sleep quality. To assess for relative efficacy, comparator groups were restricted to specific active controls (such as evidenced-based sleep treatments) and nonspecific active controls (such as time/attention-matched interventions to control for placebo effects), which were analyzed separately. From 3303 total records, 18 trials with 1654 participants were included. We determined the strength of evidence using four domains (risk of bias, directness of outcome measures, consistency of results, and precision of results). At posttreatment and follow-up, there was low strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions had no effect on sleep quality compared with specific active controls (ES 0.03 (95% CI –0.43 to 0.49)) and (ES –0.14 (95% CI –0.62 to 0.34)), respectively. Additionally, there was moderate strength of evidence that mindfulness meditation interventions significantly improved sleep quality compared with nonspecific active controls at postintervention (ES 0.33 (95% CI 0.17–0.48)) and at follow-up (ES 0.54 (95% CI 0.24–0.84)).

We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effects of psychological interventions on the ability of vaccines to protect against disease, as measured by antibody responses. Methods: Electronic databases (EMBASE, Medline, PsychINFO, CINAHL)were searched from their inception to 6th February 2018. Results: The search yielded 9 eligible trials conducted with 1603 participants and four broad categories of intervention: meditation/mindfulness (n = 3), massage (n = 3), expressive writing (n = 2)and cognitive behavioural stress management (n = 1). Some evidence of benefit on the antibody response to vaccination was observed in 6/9 of all trials and in 4/7 of randomised controlled trials. However, effects on antibody levels were often mixed, with only 3 of 6 trials showing benefit demonstrating an improvement in all antibody outcomes and at all time points assessed. Trials demonstrating benefit also provided direct or indirect evidence of adequate adherence with the intervention; and in 50% of these trials, there was also evidence that the intervention was effective in changing the mediating psychological constructs targeted by the intervention. Conclusions: This literature is characterised by considerable heterogeneity in terms of intervention type, vaccine type, age of participants and the temporal relationship between vaccination and intervention. We conclude that there is early evidence to suggest that psychological interventions may enhance the antibody response to vaccination. However, the effects are inconsistent, with the greatest likelihood of benefit seen in trials evidencing adequate adherence with the intervention. Future work would benefit from rigorous intervention development that focuses on achieving adequate adherence and large well-controlled randomised trials with a focus on an agreed set of outcomes. © 2019","Antibodies; Psychological interventions; Vaccinations","diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; influenza vaccine; vaccine; antibody response; cognitive behavioral stress management; effect size; exercise; expressive writing; human; influenza vaccination; massage; meditation; mindfulness; patient compliance; priority journal; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk benefit analysis; systematic review (topic); vaccination; vaccine failure; antibody production; clinical trial (topic); immunology; psychological and psychiatric procedures; psychology; quality of life; Antibody Formation; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Psychological Techniques; Quality of Life; Vaccination; Vaccine Potency; Vaccines",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065102531

We employed the metronome task to operationalize the extension of the present moment. A pre-post longitudinal study was conducted. The performance in the metronome task was compared before and after the interventions (meditation, story). The aim was to assess whether physiological changes (heart, breathing) during meditation influence the temporal-integration (TI) of metronome beats. Mindfulness meditators either meditated (n = 41) or listened to a story (n = 43). The heart and breathing activity were recorded during the intervention and compared to a resting-state condition. By applying path analyses we found that meditation led to an increase of the duration of integration intervals at the slowest metronome frequency (inter-stimulus interval, ISI = 3 s). After meditation, the higher the heart-rate variability (i.e., the root mean square of successive differences, RMSSD), the longer the duration of integration intervals at the fastest frequency (ISI = 0.33 s). Moreover, the higher the breathing rate during meditation, the greater the integration of intervals at ISI = 1 s. These findings add evidence to meditation-induced changes on the TI of metronome beats and the concept of the embodiment of mental functioning. © 2019 by the authors.","Auditory temporal integration; Breathing rate; Heart-rate variability; Mindfulness meditation; Present moment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067649652

Several studies suggest that the CTRA may also be down-regulated in association with some positive psychological states, particularly eudaimonic well-being. However, it is not clear if the link between inter-individual differences in the CTRA and eudaimonic well-being can be extended to intra-individual change. Using a standardized mindfulness-based intervention, the current study tested whether mindfulness-related increases in eudaimonic well-being related to intra-individual reduction in the CTRA in a sample of younger breast cancer survivors. Methods: Participants were 22 women who had been diagnosed and treated for early-stage breast cancer at or before age 50 (M age = 46.6 years) and had no evidence of active disease. Women completed self-report questionnaires and provided peripheral blood samples before and after a 6-week mindfulness meditation intervention. Regression analyses were used to quantify associations between the magnitude of change in eudaimonic well-being and the magnitude of change in the global CTRA score. Results: Women reported significant increases in eudaimonic well–being and showed decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory subcomponent of the CTRA from pre- to post-intervention. The magnitude of increase in eudaimonic well-being was associated with the magnitude of decrease in the composite CTRA score, and this relationship was driven primarily by increased expression of the antiviral/antibody-related CTRA subcomponent. While the intervention was also associated with reduced depressive symptoms, there was no association between change in depressive symptoms and change in the overall CTRA composite score or either of its subcomponents. Conclusions: Results are consistent with the hypothesis that eudaimonic well-being may be an important mechanism in interventions aimed at enhancing health in vulnerable groups, and contribute to our understanding of how psychological well-being may influence physical health in cancer patients. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Eudaimonia; Gene expression; Immune system; Mindfulness meditation; Psychoneuroimmunology","adult; Article; blood sampling; breast cancer; cancer staging; cancer survivor; clinical article; conserved transcriptional response to adversity; depression; eudaimonic wellbeing; female; gene expression; human; priority journal; questionnaire; regression analysis; scoring system; self report; wellbeing; anxiety; breast tumor; emotion; gene expression regulation; genetics; happiness; mental stress; middle aged; mindfulness; physiology; procedures; psychology; psychoneuroimmunology; survivor; transcriptome; Adult; Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; Depression; Emotions; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Happiness; Humans; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Psychoneuroimmunology; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Survivors; Transcriptome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060532946

However, many barriers to initiation and maintenance of regular physical activity have been identified. A program combining bi-weekly adapted physical activity sessions, mindfulness-based meditation and socio-aesthetic care was put together in 2015, in a Cancer Center, in order to facilitate adherence and sustainable attendance. Methods: Data on patient participation of program components, patient satisfaction, and psycho-corporal changes, collected in ecological conditions between 2015 and 2017 from 144 participants, were retrospectively analyzed to provide a first assessment. Results: Nearly 60% of the patients were in treatment, 17% were metastatic. The average participation time was 9 months, with an average of one physical activity session per week. Changes were observed, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in terms of emotional state, sleep and body image. The overall satisfaction rate was 96%. Discussion: The conclusions of the study support the continuation of the program. The methodological limitations of this pilot format may be overtaken in future research, which will allow further in-depth investigations into the effects of combined approaches on sustainable physical activity. © 2019 Société Française du Cancer","Adherence; Cancer; Mindfulness-based meditation; Physical activity; Program","Article; body image; cancer patient; esthetics; health program; human; major clinical study; malignant neoplasm; meditation; metastasis; mindfulness; patient compliance; patient participation; patient satisfaction; physical activity; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; sleep quality; social care; adult; aged; body image; evaluation study; exercise; female; France; male; middle aged; neoplasm; pilot study; prevention and control; procedures; program evaluation; psychology; statistics and numerical data; tertiary prevention; time factor; tumor recurrence; young adult; Adult; Aged; Body Image; Exercise; Female; France; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasms; Patient Satisfaction; Pilot Projects; Program Evaluation; Retrospective Studies; Tertiary Prevention; Time Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061583799

However, the involvement of inflammatory response in HFD-elicited central nerve injury has yet to be fully determined. Recent studies have indicated that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated ubiquitous scaffolding and signaling protein (TRUSS), also known as TRPC4AP, plays an essential role in regulating inflammation via the meditation of NF-κB signaling. In the present study, we attempted to explore the effects of TRUSS on HFD-induced brain injury in the wild type mice (TRUSS +/+ ) or TRUSS-knockout mice (TRUSS −/- ). The results suggested that TRUSS deletion attenuated HFD-induced cognitive impairments in mice. HFD-elicited metabolic disorders were also highly improved by the loss of TRUSS, as evidenced by the reduced serum glucose and insulin levels, as well as the lipid deposition in liver tissues. In addition, HFD-triggered brain injury was markedly alleviated by the TRUSS ablation, as proved by the reduction of GFAP and Iba1 expressions in hippocampus and hypothalamus. Moreover, TRUSS −/- mice exhibited a significant decrease in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, accompanied with the inactivation of IKKα/IκBα/NF-κB pathway. At the same time, HFD-induced dyslipidemia was also alleviated by the loss of TRUSS. The in vitro study verified the protective effects of TRUSS-suppression against HFD-induced central nerve injury and hepatic steatosis by restraining the inflammatory response. In summary, our data indicated that TRUSS participated in metabolic syndrome-induced brain injury and pointed to the repression of TRUSS as a promising strategy for cognitive deficits therapy. © 2019","Cognitive impairments; High fat diet; IKKα/IκBα/NF-κB; Inflammation; TRUSS","carrier proteins and binding proteins; glial fibrillary acidic protein; glucose; I kappa B kinase alpha; Iba1 protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin; tumor necrosis factor receptor; tumor necrosis factor receptor associated ubiquitous scaffolding and signaling protein; unclassified drug; transactivator protein; TRUSS protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain injury; brain protection; cell activation; controlled study; disease association; dyslipidemia; experimental cognitive defect; fatty liver; gene deletion; glia cell; glucose blood level; hippocampus; hypothalamus; in vitro study; inflammation; insulin blood level; insulin resistance; knockout mouse; lipid diet; lipid storage; liver tissue; male; metabolic disorder; mouse; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; upregulation; wild type mouse; adverse event; animal; brain injury; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cognitive defect; gene deletion; genetics; inflammation; lipid diet; metabolism; pathology; protection; Animals; Brain Injuries; Cells, Cultured; Cognitive Dysfunction; Diet, High-Fat; Gene Deletion; Hippocampus; Hypothalamus; Inflammation; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Protective Factors; Trans-Activators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062207307

Mindfulness meditation, by strengthening self-regulation and awareness, may optimize the efficiency of physiological, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to stressful events but typically requires notable commitment to practice, which often leads to disengagement. Recent research suggested that such practices may be made more accessible and that the potential for self-enhancement and stress management of meditation might be improved by supporting mental training with wearable neurofeedback devices able to inform the practicer on ongoing modulation of bodily and brain activity. This study aimed at testing the effect of such novel training approach based on the integration of mental training with brain-sensing wearable devices on physiological (heart rate and variability) and subjective markers of stress (perceived stress, anxiety, and mood states). Participants (N = 55) have been randomly divided into an active control (CONTg) and an experimental group (EXPg). Both groups completed a four-week training constituted by brief daily activities based on mindfulness practices. Experimental participants practiced with the support of dedicated brain-sensing devices. By analyzing pre- and post-training assessments, we observed relevantly decreased stress and anxiety measures in EXPg, as well as relevantly decreased mental fatigue and increased vigor.

The elucidation of molecular pathways and mechanisms underlying the link between stress and cellular aging is an area of considerable interest and investigation. In this context, telomere biology has emerged as a particularly attractive candidate mechanism. Several studies have linked immune cell telomere length with stress-related conditions and states, and also with several physical and mental disorders. Because the cellular reverse transcriptase enzyme telomerase is the primary regulator of telomere length (by adding telomeric DNA to telomeres and thereby attenuating telomere shortening), the understanding of its regulation and regulatory functions constitutes a prime target for developing strategies to prevent, attenuate or reverse the adverse consequences of immune system aging (immunosenescence). In this review we provide an overview of the mechanistic pathways linking telomerase with stress and cellular aging, with an emphasis on the immune system. We summarize and synthesize the current state of the literature on immune cell telomerase in different stress- and aging-related disease states and provide recommendations for future research directions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","hTERT; Immunosenescence; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; Stress hormones; Telomerase","telomerase; telomerase; acute stress; aging; autoimmune disease; cardiometabolic disease; cell aging; cell differentiation; cell function; cellular distribution; chronic stress; diet; disease association; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme regulation; exercise; human; immune system; immunocompetent cell; immunosenescence; lifestyle; meditation; mental disease; metabolic disorder; mitochondrion; nutrition; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; protein targeting; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; stress; T lymphocyte; age; genetics; immunology; immunosenescence; mental stress; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; telomere; telomere shortening; Age Factors; Cellular Senescence; Humans; Immunosenescence; Stress, Psychological; Telomerase; Telomere; Telomere Shortening",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056470361

Regarding that Iranians have a positive attitude towards complementary medicine; the demand for this type of treatments is increasing. However, those undergoing this treatment often have limited awareness on it. Objectives: This study aims at determining the perspective of cancer patients on using complementary medicine. Methods: In this descriptive study, 176 cancer patients from all over the country were selected by purposeful sampling, according to the inclusion criteria and, then, completed demographic characteristics questionnaire and the Questionnaire on Integrating Complementary Medicine in Oncology Treatment. The data were analyzed, using SPSS software version 20. Results: More than half of the patients used complementary medicine and according to their viewpoints, using herbal medicine was considered their first priority. At the same time, 46% of the research samples consulted with care providers on how to use complementary medicine for cancer treatment. The most frequent referrals to specialists were referrals to complementary medicine experts. The researchers expected complementary medicine to improve their symptoms of anxiety, fatigue, and depression. Conclusions: The use of complementary medicine as a complementary approach in cancer patients can have an impact on the improvement of symptoms, which ultimately enhances the quality of life in patients. Due to the concerns about applying these approaches, it is necessary to train care providers in order to consider the perspective of cancer patients in this regard and to obtain their past medical history. © 2019, Author(s).","Cancer; Complementary medicine; Integrative medicine; Palliative care; Symptom management","nutrition supplement; adult; aged; alternative medicine; anxiety; aromatherapy; art therapy; Article; attitude; awareness; cancer center; cancer patient; cancer therapy; Chinese medicine; constipation; Cronbach alpha coefficient; depression; diarrhea; dyspnea; fatigue; female; guided imagery; healing; health care personnel; herb; herbal medicine; homeopathy; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; meditation; middle aged; movement therapy; nutritional counseling; quality of life; questionnaire; social worker; traditional healer; traditional medicine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068821183

Subsequently, many remarkable discoveries and breakthroughs provided us with mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of AD. The identification of the molecular underpinning of the disease not only provided the framework of AD pathogenesis but also targets for therapeutic inventions. Despite all the initial successes, no effective treatment for AD has emerged yet as all the late stage of clinical trials have failed. Many factors ranging from genetic factors to environment have been critically appraised as the potential causes of AD. In particular, the role of stress on AD has been intensively studied while the relationship between sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) and AD have recently emerged. SCRD has always been thought to be a corollary of AD pathologies until recently, multiple lines of evidence converge on the notion that SCRD might be a contributing factor in AD pathogenesis. More importantly, how stress and circadian disruption intersect and make their concerted contributions to AD phenotypes has not been reviewed. The goal of this literature review is to examine at multiple levels – molecular, cellular (e.g. microglia, gut microbiota) and holistic – how the interaction between stress and SCRD bi-directionally and synergistically exacerbate AD pathologies and cognitive impairment. AD, in turn, worsens stress and SCRD and forms the vicious cycle that perpetuates and amplifies AD. © 2018 The Authors",,"amyloid beta protein; beta secretase 1; corticotropin; cryptochrome; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; melatonin; nuclear receptor NR1D1; orexin; retinoid related orphan receptor alpha; tau protein; transcription factor ARNTL; transcription factor CLOCK; Alzheimer disease; circadian rhythm; circadian rhythm sleep disorder; cognitive defect; dementia; disease course; E box element; gene mutation; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; intestine flora; locus ceruleus; MAPK signaling; meditation; microbiome; microglia; phenotype; phototherapy; polysomnography; priority journal; REM sleep; Review; role stress; sleep; sleep disordered breathing; sleep waking cycle; stress; suprachiasmatic nucleus; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057470225

It is now well recognized that chronic stress can alter the physiological cross-talk between brain and biological systems, leading to long-lasting maladaptive effects (allostatic overload) on the nervous, immune, endocrine, and metabolic systems, which compromises stress resiliency and health. Stressful conditions in early life have been associated with profound alterations in cortical and subcortical brain regions involved in emotion regulation and the salience network, showing relevant overlap with different psychiatric conditions. This paper provides a summary of the available literature concerning the notable effects of stress on the brain and immune system. We highlight the role of epigenetics as a mechanistic pathway mediating the influences of the social and physical environment on brain structure and connectivity, the immune system, and psycho-physical health in psychiatric diseases.

Meanwhile, Sophora tonkinensis Gapnep. (S. tonkinensis) held great value in the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine, but cardiotoxic effects were reported, with matrine, oxymatrine, cytisine, and sophocarpine being the primary toxic components. Methods: In this study, impedance and extracellular field potential (EFP) of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) were recorded using the cardio non-labeled cell function analysis and culture system (Cardio-NLCS). The effects of matrine, oxymatrine, cytisine, and sophocarpine (2, 10, 50 μM) on cell viability; level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (CTn-I); antioxidant activities; production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA); and disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis were also added into the integrated assessment. Results: The results showed that matrine and sophocarpine dose-dependently affected both impedance and EFP, while oxymatrine and cytisine altered impedance significantly. Our study also indicated that cardiotoxicity of matrine, oxymatrine, cytisine, and sophocarpine was related to the disruption of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress. Four alkaloids of S. tonkinensis showed significant cardiotoxicity with dose dependence and structural cardiotoxicity synchronized with functional changes of cardiomyocytes. Conclusions: This finding may provide guidance for clinical meditation management. Furthermore, this study introduced an efficient and reliable approach, which offers alternative options for evaluating the cardiotoxicity of the listed drugs and novel drug candidates. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cardio-NLCS; Cardiotoxicity; hiPSC-CMs; Sophora tonkinensis","alkaloid; creatine kinase MB; cytisine; glutathione; lactate dehydrogenase; malonaldehyde; matrine; oxymatrine; reactive oxygen metabolite; sophocarpine; superoxide dismutase; troponin I; unclassified drug; alkaloid; azocine derivative; cytisine; matrine; oxymatrine; quinolizine derivative; sophocarpine; antioxidant activity; Article; calcium homeostasis; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cell function; cell viability; controlled study; electric potential; heart electrophysiology; heart muscle contractility; human; human cell; impedance; oxidative stress; plant root; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; Sophora; Sophora tonkinensis; cardiac muscle cell; cardiotoxicity; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; extracellular fluid; heart contraction; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; physiology; Sophora; Alkaloids; Azocines; Cardiotoxicity; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Electric Impedance; Extracellular Fluid; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Myocardial Contraction; Myocytes, Cardiac; Quinolizines; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sophora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059856798

Stress due to the TTH headache is a very frequent occurrence in all of our lives. When a TTH symptom is experienced for a long time by an individual with no relief or with increased frequency, it is termed as “distress.” Weakened cognitive and physiological control is due to TTH-originated stress and, as a result, performance reduction. It can lead to symptoms such as headache, gastrointestinal disturbance, elevated blood pressure, chest pain, insomnia, peptic ulcers, sexual dysfunction, skin ailments, etc. The present chapter is an effort to scientifically analyze the two popular biofeedback therapies (EMG and GSR) on audio and visual modes for the treatment of TTH in the experimental period of 12months. Authors have attempted to verify the hypothesis and establish which kind of therapy is more useful through comparison between both therapies in audio, visual, and audio-visual modes as well as comparison among EMGa, EMGv, and EMGav modes. This chapter also makes use of multimedia and Internet-of-Things (IoT) to detect the TTH and to analyze the chronicity. The chapter also includes the concept of big data for the storage and processing of data that is generated while analyzing the TTH stress through IoT.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","Telomeres are the heterochromatic repeat regions at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that maintain the genomic integrity of a cell. Telomere shortening with increasing age is a part of the normal ageing process. However, factors such as inflammation, oxidative stress and other genotoxic stressors may also increase the rate of telomere attrition, leading to telomere dysfunction-mediated cellular senescence and accelerating the ageing process. Once telomeres shorten to a critical length, the cell encounters a proliferation block where it either ceases to divide or undergoes programmed cell death. Thus, telomere length is considered a biological clock that limits the lifespan of a cell and an organism: people with short telomeres often have reduced lifespan. Certain lifestyle factors such as smoking, body mass index and psychological stress have been found to correlate with accelerated telomere shortening, likely because they increase DNA damage through oxidative stress. Recently, studies have identified lifestyle factors that can potentially protect telomeres. For example, people who lead a healthy lifestyle by increasing their physical activity, practising meditation, adhering to the Mediterranean diet and using multivitamins have been shown to have longer telomeres than those who do not adhere to such lifestyle changes. This chapter highlights the influence of lifestyle factors on key biological mechanisms associated with telomere maintenance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Ageing; Inflammation; Lifestyle; Oxidative stress; Telomere",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098127066

Besides affecting the individual, it can compromise patient safety and quality of care as well. Meditation practice is getting recognized for its ability to improve wellness among various populations, including healthcare providers. Methods: Baseline stress levels of perioperative healthcare providers were measured via an online survey using a Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire. An in-person meditation workshop was demonstrated during surgical grand rounds and an international anesthesia conference using a 15-minute guided Isha Kriya meditation. The participants were then surveyed for mood changes before and after meditation using a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Results: Surgeons and anesthesiologists were found to have higher median (interquartile range) Perceived Stress Scores as compared to nurses respectively (17 [12, 20] and 17 [12, 21] vs 14 [9, 19]; P = 0.01). Total mood disturbances were found to be significantly reduced after meditation in both the surgical grand rounds (pre-meditation median [IQR] 99 [85, 112] vs 87 [80, 93] post-meditation; P < 0.0001) and anesthesia conference cohorts (pre-meditation 92 [86, 106] vs 87 [81, 92] post-meditation; P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Isha Kriya, a guided meditation, is easy to learn and takes less than 15 minutes to complete.

However, a large proportion of patients do not experience symptomatic remission after the initial treatment, with even lower rates of remission in the longer treatment term. The main objective of individualized treatment applied in psychiatry is to improve precision in disease diagnosis, prognosis, treatment choices, and treatment response. Diverse approaches and techniques, such as genomics, epigenomics, other omics, neural circuit, and artificial intelligence are related to precision psychiatry. Using biology and computational psychiatry tools to find potential biomarkers, and based on precision psychiatry, patients considered to belong to the same endophenotype will be possible to receive biomarkers-based treatment and better prognosis. Especially in the choice of intervention, individualized treatment should be considered. In this review, we present the development of precise treatment in depressive disorders and introduce advances in several domains toward precision medicine and individualized treatment.

Data were obtained using a questionnaire that was prepared by the researchers considering the literature data. Results. The mean age of the patients was 37.98 ± 15.65 years. Of the 951 patients, 48.4% (n D 460) were female and 51.6% (n D 491) were male. The rate of patients who used CAM at least once was 47.3% (n D 450). The most frequently used CAM methods were herbal therapy (68.9%), massage (40.7%), dietary supplements (24.7%), and hijama (24.2%). Being aged 64 years or younger (pD0:001), having an education level of university or higher (pD0:006), having an income more than minimum wage (pD0:016), and having a chronic disease (pD0:003) were found to be associated with CAM use in this study. Discussion.CAMmethods were used by a considerable proportion of patients admitted to the ER. Physicians should incorporate CAM use history in their patient assessments and should provide accurate and unbiased information about CAM methods. © 2019 Hakkoymaz et al.","Alternative medicine; Complementary medicine; Emergency room","erbium; acupuncture; adult; alternative medicine; apitherapy; aromatherapy; Article; chiropractic; dietary supplement; educational status; emergency ward; female; herbal medicine; hospital patient; human; hypnosis; leeching; major clinical study; male; massage; meditation; mesotherapy; music therapy; osteopathic medicine; ozone therapy; patient assessment; prolotherapy; questionnaire; tertiary care center; wet cupping",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074158051

In this review article, we present a novel model for understanding, preventing, and treating age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) based on concepts borrowed from precision medicine. We will discuss how multiple risk factors can be classified into risk categories because of their interrelatedness in real life, the genetic variants that increase sensitivity to, or ameliorate, risk for ARCI, and the brain drivers or common mechanisms mediating brain aging. Rather than providing a definitive model of risk for ARCI and cognitive decline, the Precision Aging model is meant as a starting point to guide future research. To that end, after briefly discussing key risk categories, genetic risks, and brain drivers, we conclude with a discussion of steps that must be taken to move the field forward. © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

However, the widely adopted physiological interpretations of the LF and HF components in SNS /PNS balance are now questioned, which puts under serious scrutiny stress assessments which employ the LF and HF components. To avoid these controversies, we here introduce the novel Classification Angle (ClassA) framework, which yields a family of metrics which quantify cardiac dynamics in three-dimensions. This is achieved using a finite-difference plot of HRV, which displays successive rates of change of HRV, and is demonstrated to provide sufficient degrees of freedom to determine cardiac deceleration and/or acceleration. The robustness and accuracy of the novel ClassA framework is verified using HRV signals from ten males, recorded during standardized stress tests, consisting of rest, mental arithmetic, meditation, exercise and further meditation. Comparative statistical testing demonstrates that unlike the existing LF-HF metrics, the ClassA metrics are capable of distinguishing both the physical and mental stress epochs from the epochs of no stress, with statistical significance (Bonferroni corrected p-value ≤ 0.025); HF was able to distinguish physical stress from no stress, but was not able to identify mental stress. The ClassA results also indicated that at moderate levels of stress, the extent of parasympathetic withdrawal was greater than the extent of sympathetic activation. Finally, the analyses and the experimental results provide conclusive evidence that the proposed nonlinear approach to quantify cardiac activity from HRV resolves three critical obstacles to current HRV stress assessments: (i) it is not based on controversial assumptions of balance between the LF and HF powers; (ii) its temporal resolution when estimating parasympathetic dominance is as little as 10 s of HRV data, while only 60 s to estimate sympathetic dominance; (iii) unlike LF and HF analyses, the ClassA framework does not require the prohibitive assumption of signal stationarity. The ClassA framework is unique in offering HRV based stress analysis in three-dimensions. © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Little is known about interest in and use of CIM approaches by oncology patients in Chile and South America. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients presenting for conventional outpatient or inpatient medical oncology care at the Clinica Alemana in Santiago, Chile, from March to June 2017 were asked to complete a survey about their interest in and use of CIM approaches. Goals included determining the prevalence of CIM use and exploring associations between CIM use and patient characteristics. Statistical analyses included a two-tailed t test for continuous variables, Fischer’s exact test for categorical variables, and logistic regression for association between CIM use and other variables. RESULTS Of 432 patients surveyed, 66.9% were diagnosed with breast cancer, 84.8% were women, the majority of patients (58.1%) were between age 40 and 60 years, and 51.5% (n = 221) reported CIM use. No association was found between CIM use and the sociodemographic variables of sex, age, education, or income. In all, 44.6% of patients with breast cancer reported CIM use compared with 64.8% of patients with other cancer types (P . .001). Most commonly reported types of CIM used included herbals (49.1%), vitamins and minerals (40.8%), and prayer or meditation (40.4%). Most frequent reasons for CIM use were to “do everything possible” (72%) and to “improve my immune function” (67.8%). Most patients (43.4%) reported starting CIM use at the time of cancer diagnosis, with only 55.4% sharing information regarding CIM use with their medical team. CONCLUSION The majority of patients surveyed reported engaging in CIM use, with just over half the users communicating with their oncology team about their CIM use. Increased awareness of regional differences in CIM use may help increase communication regarding this subject and contribute to improved outcomes. © 2019 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",,"mineral; vitamin; adult; age; alternative medicine; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer therapy; Chile; clinical feature; education; female; health survey; help seeking behavior; herbal medicine; hospital patient; human; immunity; income; information dissemination; integrative medicine; major clinical study; male; medical care; meditation; outpatient; prevalence; priority journal; Review; sex",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066846500

Therefore, new conceptual frameworks are needed to identify pathophysiologic pathways and neurobiological targets for the development of novel treatment strategies. In this regard, recent evidence suggests that inflammation may contribute to symptoms relevant to a number of psychiatric disorders and particularly depression. Numerous studies (including meta-analyses) have found elevated peripheral and central inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins in depression. Chronic exposure to increased inflammation is thought to drive changes in neurotransmitters and neurocircuits that lead to depressive symptoms and that may also interfere with or circumvent the efficacy of antidepressants. Indeed, patients with high inflammation have been shown to exhibit poor response to conventional antidepressant therapies. Recent developments in our ability to understand and measure the effects of inflammation on the brain in patients have opened new doors for the testing of novel treatment strategies that target the immune system or its consequences on neurotransmitter systems. Such recent developments in the field of behavioral immunology and their translational implications for the treatment of depression are discussed herein. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anhedonia; Anti-inflammatories; Anxiety; Cytokines; Depression; Dopamine; Glutamate; Inflammation; Motor slowing; Neuroimaging","5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid; 5 methyltetrahydrofolic acid; acetylsalicylic acid; acute phase protein; amfebutamone; antidepressant agent; brain derived neurotrophic factor; C reactive protein; celecoxib; DNA; dopamine; escitalopram; glutamic acid; icosapentaenoic acid; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; infliximab; interleukin 1; interleukin 18; interleukin 6; ketamine; kynurenine; levodopa; memantine; neurotransmitter; nortriptyline; serotonin; serotonin uptake inhibitor; sirukumab; tumor necrosis factor; unindexed drug; antidepressant agent; cytokine; anxiety; bipolar depression; body weight loss; cognition; cognitive behavioral therapy; cytokine production; depression; diet supplementation; drug efficacy; early life stress; environmental factor; fear; functional connectivity; gene expression; genetic predisposition; human; inflammation; innate immunity; kinesiotherapy; lifestyle; massage; medical research; meditation; mental stress; mesenchymal stem cell transplantation; nerve cell plasticity; neurobiology; nonhuman; priority journal; reward; striate cortex; symptom; T lymphocyte; Tai Chi; treatment response; yoga; brain; chemistry; depression; physiology; Antidepressive Agents; Brain; Cytokines; Depression; Humans; Inflammation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066843366

PTSD is a multimodal psycho-physiological-behavioral disorder, which calls for the potential usefulness of spiritual therapy. Recent times witness a substantial scientific interest in an alternative mind-to-body psychobehavioral therapy; the exemplary of which is meditation. Meditation is a form of mental exercise that has an extensive, albeit still mostly empiric, therapeutic value. Meditation steadily gains an increasing popularity as a psychobehavioral adjunct to therapy in many areas of medicine and psychology. While the review does not provide a final or conclusive answer on the use of meditation in PTSD treatment we believe the available empirical evidence demonstrates that meditation is associated with overall reduction in PTSD symptoms, and it improves mental and somatic quality of life of PTSD patients. Therefore, studies give a clear cue for a trial of meditation-associated techniques as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy or standalone treatment in otherwise resistant cases of the disease. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Breathing; Meditation; Mindfulness of breathing; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Psychobehavioral therapy","chronic pain; comorbidity; emotion; human; hypnosis; meditation; mindfulness; mood; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; psychological well-being; psychosis; quality of life; socioeconomics; stress management; transcendental meditation; veteran; posttraumatic stress disorder; Humans; Meditation; Quality of Life; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056327767

Yoga Meditation relieves our mental stress and re-establishes mental harmony when practiced regularly, and hence, it promotes physical, mental, and spiritual health. The previous studies on meditation show that there is relationship between mindful meditation, brain, and heart. As the meditation has direct impact on the mind power, the mental health is influenced by the depth of meditation. Also, brain and mind has the direct control over the heart, and physical health is indirectly related by mindful meditation. Experimental investigations on the effect of meditation are proposed by monitoring electroelectroencephalogram (EEG) with using brain–computer interface (BCI). The brain waves of the person who is under meditation will be captured using Neurosky BCI mind wave kit. The mental health status is analyzed by monitoring alpha, beta, and theta brain waves during long meditation. The impact of mediation on the heart rate variation (HRV), respiration rate, and blood pressure, etc., is monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of meditation on the physical health status. The captured brain waves through Neurosky BCI mindwave kit are filtered to get alpha and beta waves. The alpha and beta brain waves are analyzed using BCI Graphical User Interface (GUI) software tool to investigate the power levels of each wave and duration before and after meditation. The observed data was further analyzed through IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) tool for studying about mean, standard deviation, and variance of brain wave parameters, which shows the positive impact on physical as well as mental health parameters, especially cardiovascular (CV), and heart rate variation (HRV) parameters, etc. © 2019, The Author(s).","Electroelectroencephalogram (EEG); Meditation; Yoga","Blood pressure; Brain computer interface; Graphical user interfaces; Heart; Machinery; Electroelectroencephalogram (EEG); Experimental investigations; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Heart rate variations; Meditation; Standard deviation; Statistical packages; Yoga; Health",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049750854

Dysregulation in selective transcripts delivered to oocyte at fertilization can result in pregnancy losses and adversely affect embryogenesis. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) on seminal oxidative stress (OS), DNA damage and spermatozoal transcript levels. Methods: The present study was a part of a prospective ongoing exploratory study and 30 male partners of couples with RPL were included from August 2016 to June 2017. Semen samples were obtained at baseline and at the end of YBLI (21 days). Gene expression analysis was performed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction on spermatozoal FOXG1, SOX3, OGG1, PARP1, RPS6, RBM9, RPS17 and RPL29. The levels of seminal OS and sperm DNA damage was assessed by measuring levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by chemiluminescence and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) by sperm chromatin structure assay. Results: SOX3, OGG1 and PARP1 were observed to be upregulated, while FOXG1, RPS6, RBM9, RPS17 and RPL29 showed downregulation. A significant reduction in ROS levels, an increase in sperm motility, sperm count (done twice) and a decrease in DFI was seen after YBLI. Interpretation & conclusions: Adopting YBLI may help in a significant decline in oxidative DNA damage and normalization of sperm transcript levels. This may not only improve pregnancy outcomes but also improve the health trajectory of the offspring. © 2019 Indian Journal of Medical Research.","Dysregulation; meditation; oxidative stress; sperm DNA damage; sperm transcript; yoga","beta actin; complementary DNA; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; reactive oxygen metabolite; reactive oxygen metabolite; abortion; Article; chemoluminescence; chromatin structure; chromatin structure assay; DNA damage; DNA fragmentation; DNA fragmentation index; down regulation; female; FOXG1 gne; gene; gene expression; housekeeping gene; human; liquefaction; male; OGG1 gne; oxidative stress; PARP1 gne; polymerase chain reaction; prospective study; RBM9 gne; recurrent pregnancy loss; RPL29 gne; RPS17 gne; RPS6 gne; SOX3 gne; spectrophotometry; sperm; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon motility; upregulation; yoga; adult; chromatin; DNA damage; genetics; male infertility; meditation; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; semen analysis; sperm; Adult; Chromatin; DNA Damage; Female; Humans; Infertility, Male; Male; Meditation; Oxidative Stress; Pregnancy; Reactive Oxygen Species; Semen; Semen Analysis; Sperm Motility; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063941943

The term mindfulness is often used as an umbrella for a variety of different practices and many mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) contain multiple styles of practice. Despite the diversity of practices within MBIs, few studies have investigated whether constituent practices produce specific effects. We randomized 156 undergraduates to one of four brief practices: breath awareness, loving-kindness, gratitude, or to an attention control condition. We assessed practice effects on affect following brief training, and effects on affect and behavior after provocation with a stressor (i.e., Cold pressor test). Results indicate that gratitude training significantly improved positive affect compared to breath awareness (d = 0.58) and loving-kindness led to significantly greater reductions in implicit negative affect compared to the control condition (d = 0.59) immediately after brief practice. In spite of gains in positive affect, the gratitude group demonstrated increased reactivity to the stressor, reporting the CPT as significantly more aversive than the control condition (d = 0.46) and showing significantly greater increases in negative affect compared to the breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, respectively). Greater gains in implicit positive affect following gratitude training predicted decreased post-stressor likability ratings of novel neutral faces compared to breath awareness, loving-kindness, and control groups (ds = - 0.39, -0.40, -0.33, respectively) as well. Moreover, the gratitude group was significantly less likely to donate time than the loving-kindness group in an ecologically valid opportunity to provide unrewarded support. These data suggest that different styles of contemplative practice may produce different effects in the context of brief, introductory practice and these differences may be heightened by stress. Implications for the study of contemplative practices are discussed. © 2018 Hirshberg et al.

However, the pathogenesis of osteoporosis induced by diabetes has not been fully understood. MLN64 is highly homologous to the steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein, sharing the highly conserved START domain and exhibiting various biological activities. In the study, we attempted to explore the role of MLN64 in osteoporosis progression through the in vitro and in vivo studies. At first, the in vitro study suggested that MLN64 was over-expressed during the osteoclast differentiation induced by receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL). MLN64-knockdown markedly reduced the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells induced by RANKL, along with the down-regulation of specific genes related to osteoclastogenesis, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1), cathepsin K (CTSK), tartrate resistant (ACP5) and c-FOS and up-regulation of transcriptional receptor runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteopontin (OPN). In contrast, over-expressing MLN64 significantly promoted the production of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells triggered by RANKL. Moreover, RANKL exposure led to remarkable increase in inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and MMP-1, which was attenuated by the knockdown of MLN64. Additionally, the expression of phosphorylated (p)–IKKα, p-IκBα and p-nuclear factor (NF)-κB stimulated by RANKL was clearly alleviated by MLN64 silence. However, RANKL-induced inflammation was accelerated by MLN64 over-expression. Further, the in vivo study suggested that streptozotocin (STZ)-caused reduction in body weight of mice was improved by the loss of MLN64. STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited higher levels of blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and TRAP, while being down-regulated in MLN64-knockout mice. MLN64 deletion reversed STZ-induced trabecular deleterious effects and stimulated bone remodeling. What's more, MLN64 knockout inhibited the expression levels of TRAP, RANKL and RANK in femoral heads of STZ mice, accompanied with the repression of inflammatory response. In conclusion, the results in our study suggested that MLN64 played a critical role in the meditation of osteoclastic differentiation, and its suppression alleviated diabetic osteoporosis in STZ-induced mice. Thus, MLN64 could be served as an essential target for developing effective therapeutic strategy to prevent diabetic osteoporosis. © 2018","Inflammation; MLN64; NF-κB; Osteoclast differentiation; Osteoporosis","acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; alkaline phosphatase; cathepsin K; I kappa B kinase alpha; I kappa B kinase beta; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interstitial collagenase; MLN64 protein; osteoclast differentiation factor; osteopontin; protein c fos; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; transcription factor RUNX2; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; autacoid; MLN64 protein, mouse; osteoclast differentiation factor; phosphoprotein; ACP5 gene; alkaline phosphatase blood level; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone remodeling; cell count; cell differentiation; controlled study; CTSK gene; diabetes mellitus; down regulation; femoral head; gene; gene deletion; gene knockdown; gene knockout; gene overexpression; gene silencing; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; knockout mouse; mouse; NFATc1 gene; nonhuman; oncogene c fos; OPN gene; osteoclast; osteoporosis; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; protein expression level; Runx2 gene; TRAP gene; upregulation; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell differentiation; complication; cytology; experimental diabetes mellitus; genetics; metabolism; osteoclast; osteoporosis; physiology; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Inflammation Mediators; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Osteoclasts; Osteoporosis; Phosphoproteins; RANK Ligand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056069307

The core teaching of Buddha was the Four Noble Truths: there is suffering, suffering is caused by clinging and ignorance, there is a way out of suffering and that way is the Noble Eightfold Path. The medical analogy in diabetes care would include identification of diabetes, understanding its etiopathogenesis, and how prognosis can be improved with appropriate care and management of this chronic disorder. Gaining awareness about the cause of illness and conducting our lives in a manner that nourishes and maintains long-term good health leads to improved outcomes for individuals living with diabetes and improve their overall well-being. The Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism constitutes of right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. These elements of the Eightfold Path can be taken as guiding principles in diabetes care. Buddhist meditation techniques, including mindfulness meditation-based strategies, have been used for stress reduction and management of chronic disorders such as chronic pain, depression, anxiety, hypertension, and diabetes. In this article, we focus on how Buddhist philosophy offers several suggestions, precepts, and practices that guide a diabetic individual toward holistic health. © 2018 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.","Buddhism; diabetes care; four noble truths; liberating insight; meditation; metabolic karma; mindfulness meditation; mindfulness-based stress reduction dharma; Noble Eightfold Path; suffering","Article; Buddhism; Buddhist; diabetes care; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; holistic care; human; karma; meditation; mindfulness; patient care; philosophy; priority journal; stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058626901

However, while the connection between Buddhism and healthcare has long been noted, there is scarce literature on how Buddhist philosophy can guide health-care practitioners in their professional as well as personal lives. In the sutras, we find analogies that describe the Buddha as a doctor, knowledge of Dharma as the treatment, and all lay people as patients. The occurrence of disease is closely related to one's mental, physical and spiritual health, society, culture, and environment. It is not enough to approach medicine in a manner that simply eradicates symptoms; the psychosocial aspects of disease and its mind based causes and remedies must be a primary consideration. Holistic care involves harmonization of all these elements, and the Buddhist philosophy offers great insight for the physician. The Buddhist medical literature lays out moral guidelines and ethics for a health-care practitioner and this has corollaries in the principles of medical ethics: nonmaleficence, benevolence, justice, and autonomy. There is emphasis on loving-kindness, compassion, empathy, and equanimity as key attributes of an ideal physician. The practice of medicine is a stressful profession with physician burnout an often neglected problem. Mindfulness meditation, as developed in Buddhism, can help health-care professionals cope up with the stress and develop the essential attributes to improve patient care and self-care. This article outlines the spiritual and ethical values which underlie Buddhist concern for the sick and gives an overview of lessons which health-care practitioners can imbibe from Buddhism. © 2018 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.","Buddhism; equanimity; health-care practitioner; holistic care; loving kindness; medical ethics; mindfulness meditation; mindfulness-based stress reduction; physician burnout; physician's vows; self-compassion","Article; Buddhism; Buddhist; burnout; compassion; cultural factor; doctor patient relation; empathy; equanimity; health care personnel; human; institutionalization; lifestyle modification; loving kindness; medical ethics; mindfulness; patient care; philosophy; practice guideline; priority journal; quality of life; social behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058621309

However, few works have attempted to reveal the relationships between tai chi, executive control, and emotion regulation in the same study. The current resting-state study investigated whether the impact of tai chi on elders’ emotion regulation was mediated by the resting-state functional connectivity within the executive control network. A total of 26 elders with long-term tai chi experience and 26 demographically matched healthy elders were recruited. After the resting-state scan, both groups were required to complete a series of questionnaires, including the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and a sequential decision task, which offered an index of the subjects’ emotion-regulation ability by calculating how their emotional response could be affected by the objective outcomes of their decisions. Compared to the control group, the tai chi group showed higher levels of non-judgment of inner experiences (a component of the FFMQ), stronger emotion-regulation ability, and a weaker resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Moreover, the functional connectivity between the DLPFC and the MFG in the tai chi group fully mediated the impact of non-judgment of inner experience on their emotion-regulation ability. These findings highlighted that the modulation of non-judgment of inner experience on long-term tai chi practitioners’ emotion regulation was achieved through decreased functional connectivity within the executive control network. © Copyright © 2018 Liu, Wu, Li and Guo.","emotion regulation; executive control network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; meditation; resting-state functional connectivity; tai chi","aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; emotion regulation; executive network; exercise; female; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; male; meditation; middle frontal gyrus; mindfulness; physician; questionnaire; Tai Chi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061057312

Supportive treatments are increasingly used to alleviate distress in cancer. In this study, the effects of yoga on these symptoms are examined. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled study on cancer patients with mixed diagnoses comparing yoga therapy with a waiting list control group. We measured anxiety symptoms with the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and fatigue with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Fatigue scale (EORTC QLQ-FA13). Yoga therapy was carried out in weekly sessions of 60 min each for 8 weeks. The program provided restrained body and breathing exercises as well as meditation. The control group did not receive any yoga therapy while on the waiting list. Results: A total of 70 subjects participated in the study. Anxiety was significantly reduced by the yoga therapy in the intervention group compared to the control group (p = 0.005). However, yoga therapy did not show any significant effects on depression (p = 0.21) and fatigue (p = 0.11) compared to the control group. Conclusion: Yoga therapy may be used to alleviate anxiety symptoms in cancer patients and should be the subject of further research. © 2018 S.

The interviews were examined using thematic analysis. 14 data-driven themes were extracted and organized within a framework consisting of three superordinate theory-driven forms of motivation: External, internal and service. A developmental trajectory running from external and internal to service motivations is indicated. This approach improves upon a scheme developed by Shapiro by including additional types of motivations and being able to differentiate between forms of motivations that are fundamentally different: Self-related (heteronomous and autonomous) motivations and other-related motivations. © 2018 Sparby, Ott.

ASCO considered the guideline for endorsement. Methods The SIO guideline addressed the use of integrative therapies for the management of symptoms and adverse effects, such as anxiety and stress, mood disorders, fatigue, quality of life, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, lymphedema, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, pain, and sleep disturbance. Interventions of interest included mind and body practices, natural products, and lifestyle modifications. SIO systematic reviews focused on randomized controlled trials that were published from 1990 through 2015. The SIO guideline was reviewed by ASCO content experts for clinical accuracy and by ASCO methodologists for developmental rigor. On favorable review, an ASCO Expert Panel was convened to review the guideline contents and recommendations. Results The ASCO Expert Panel determined that the recommendations in the SIO guideline-published in 2017-are clear, thorough, and based on the most relevant scientific evidence. ASCO endorsed the guideline with a few added discussion points. Recommendations Key recommendations include the following: Music therapy, meditation, stress management, and yoga are recommended for anxiety/stress reduction. Meditation, relaxation, yoga, massage, and music therapy are recommended for depression/mood disorders. Meditation and yoga are recommended to improve quality of life. Acupressure and acupuncture are recommended for reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Acetyl-L-carnitine is not recommended to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy because of a possibility of harm. No strong evidence supports the use of ingested dietary supplements to manage breast cancer treatment-related adverse effects.

Participants practiced the protocol that was specially designed for senior citizens, keeping in mind their health status and physical limitations. Aim: The present study was planned to evaluate possible changes in lung functioning assessed through Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) in senior citizens following 12 weeks of an integrated Silver Yoga programme. Materials and Methods: In this comparative pre-post study, 40 elderly women inmates of the hospice were randomised into two groups of 20 each. Yoga group (Group A) received training in the integrated Silver Yoga programme while control group (Group B) did not receive any yoga training. Both the groups however participated in all the routine activities of the Hospice. Anthropometric data, respiratory rate and lung function parameters were recorded before and after the 12-week study period. Intra-group and inter-group comparisons of pre and post study data were done using Student’s paired and unpaired t-test respectively. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate significant differences between means. Results: After the 12 weeks of Silver Yoga, both weight and BMI showed significant reduction (p<0.05) in Group A, whereas there was an insignificant increase in Group B. Lung function tests such as FVC, FEV1, PEFR, and FIVC increased significantly (p<0.05) after yoga training, whereas FVC decreased significantly (p<0.05) in the Group B. Group A showed significant decrease in both Respiratory Rate (RR) (p<0.01) and Lung Age (p<0.001) while FEF25-75 increased significantly in both groups. Conclusion: Results of this pilot study give preliminary evidence that incorporation of Yoga as part of senior’s lifestyle can help in promoting health thereby, modifying age related disorders. It is however, limited by the smaller sample size, also limited to a single centre. Further multi-centric studies with larger populations can deepen understanding of intrinsic mechanisms by which these changes are occurring in Silver Yoga. © 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Although, yoga is used as a mind-body exercise to increase physical fitness, data on effectiveness of long-term training of yoga on cardio-respiratory fitness in healthy adults is least available. Aim: To find out the effect of Yoga practice on Physical Fitness Index (PFI) and Maximum Oxygen Consumption (VO2 max) in healthy adults. Materials and Methods: A pre-post interventional study was conducted on 200 (120 male and 80 female) healthy subjects. An intervention of Yoga (Asanas, Pranayama and Meditation) for six months (one hour per day, six days per week) was given. Weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Physical Fitness Index (PFI) and VO2 max were determined. PFI and VO2 max were determined by using modified Harvard Step Test (HST) and modified Queen’s College Step Test (QST), respectively. Data was collected at baseline and after six months of yoga training. Collected result data was analysed by using paired t-test. Results: Yoga practice for six months caused significant reduction in weight and BMI (p&lt;0.0001) and significant increase in BMR (p=0.005), PFI (p&lt;0.0001) and VO2 max (p&lt;0.0001).

Methods: Data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which represents non-institutionalized adults aged 65 or older (n = 7,116 unweighted), were used. We elicited seven most common CHA used in older adults, which are acupuncture, herbal therapies, chiropractic, massage, meditation, Tai Chi, and yoga. Survey participants were asked to self-report perceived benefits (eg, maintaining health and stress reduction) in their CHA used. We estimated prevalence and perceived benefits of CHA use. We also investigated socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with the use of any of these seven CHA. Results: Overall, 29.2% of older adults used any of seven CHA in the past year. Most commonly used CHA included herbal therapies (18.1%), chiropractic (8.4%), and massage (5.7%). More than 60% of older CHA users reported that CHA were important for maintaining health and well-being. Other perceived benefits included improving overall health and feeling better (52.3%), giving a better sense of control over health (27.4%), and making it easier to cope with health problems (24.7%). Older adults with higher education and income levels, ≥2 chronic conditions, and functional limitations had greater odds of using CHA (p < .01, respectively). Conclusion: A substantial number of older CHA users reported CHA-related benefits. CHA may play a crucial role in improving health status among older adults. At the population level, further research on the effects of CHA use on bio-psycho-social outcomes is needed to promote healthy aging in older adults. © The Author(s) 2018.

Mindfulness interventions can reduce distress and improve quality of life in cancer patients. However, standard mindfulness training relies on in-person instruction, which is often not practical for either patients receiving chemotherapy or their caregivers. In the Being Present single arm pilot study, we designed and tested an 8-week audio-based mindfulness meditation program for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy with or without a participating caregiver. The study accrued 33 of 74 (45%) eligible patients consenting together with 20 family caregivers (53 participants total) within nine months. Forty-one participants were evaluable (77%); 10 of 12 cases of attrition were attributable to hospitalization or death. Median participant age was 51 (range 21–78 years); 38% were men. Baseline levels of distress were similar in patients and caregivers. The top reasons for participation cited in pre-intervention interviews were to increase relaxation/calm, improve mood/emotions, and reduce stress/anxiety. In measures of adherence, 59% of responses to weekly texts asking: “Have you practiced today?” were “Yes” and 59% of interviewees reported practicing >50% of the time. Compared to baseline, post-intervention surveys demonstrated significantly reduced distress (p = 0.01) and anxiety (p = 0.03); as well as increased non-reactivity (p<0.01), and feeling at peace (p<0.01). Post-intervention qualitative interviews, where 71% of participants reported benefit, were consistent with quantitative findings. In the interviews, participants spontaneously described reduced stress/anxiety and increased relaxation/calm. Benefits appeared to be accentuated in patient-caregiver pairs as compared to unpaired patients. Seventy-nine percent of participants reported plans for continued practice after study completion. We conclude that the Being Present audio-based mindfulness meditation program is of interest to, feasible, and acceptable for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and caregivers, with initial evidence of efficacy. These results will guide plans for a follow-up study. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02423720 © 2018 Atreya et al.

IL-22 binds specifically to its heterodimeric receptor, which is expressed on a variety of epithelial tissues. UTTR1147A is a recombinant fusion protein that links the human cytokine IL-22 with the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4. Here, we report extensive in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies that were conducted to characterize the pharmacological activity of UTTR1147A. The in vitro activity and potency of UTTR1147A were analyzed using primary human hepatocytes and human colonic epithelial cell lines. Assessment of in vivo efficacy was performed in a mouse colitis model and by measuring relevant pharmacodynamic biomarkers, including antimicrobial peptides REG3A/β serum amyloid protein A (SAA) and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of UTTR1147A were assessed in healthy mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. UTTR1147A induced STAT3 activation through binding to IL-22 receptor expressed in primary human hepatocytes and human colon cell lines. In both, activation occurred in a concentration-dependent manner with similar potencies. In the mouse colitis model, murine IL-22Fc- (muIL-22Fc) treated groups at doses of 1.25 μg and above had statistically lower average histologic colitis scores compared to the control treated group. Administration of muIL-22Fc or UTTR1147A was associated with a dose-dependent induction of PD markers REG3β and SAA in rodents as well as REG3A, SAA and LBP in cynomolgus monkeys. The combined data confirm pharmacological activity of IL-22Fc and support potential regenerative and protective mechanisms in epithelial tissues. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Epithelial tissues; Fc fusion protein; IL-22; Pharmacology; Regenerative","antiinflammatory agent; fusion protein; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 22; interleukin receptor; lipopolysaccharide binding protein; peptide; recombinant protein; reg3a peptide; serum amyloid A; unclassified drug; uttr 1147a; cytokine; immunoglobulin G; interleukin derivative; interleukin-22; recombinant protein; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; area under the curve; Article; colitis; drug activity; female; HCE cell line (colon epithelium); histopathology; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; infection; inflammation; liver cell; Macaca fascicularis; male; maximum concentration; mouse; nonhuman; pharmacodynamics; priority journal; rat; animal; C57BL mouse; cell line; chemically induced; colitis; metabolism; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Area Under Curve; Cell Line; Colitis; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Interleukins; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Recombinant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052566594

Objective To assess preventive effects of meditation and exercise on acute respiratory infection (ARI) illness. Design Randomized controlled prevention trial with three parallel groups. Setting Madison, Wisconsin, USA. Participants Community-recruited adults who did not regularly exercise or meditate. Methods 1) 8-week behavioral training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR); 2) matched 8-week training in moderate intensity sustained exercise (EX); or 3) observational waitlist control. Training classes occurred in September and October, with weekly ARI surveillance through May. Incidence, duration, and area-under-curve ARI global severity were measured using daily reports on the WURSS-24 during ARI illness. Viruses were identified multiplex PCR. Absenteeism, health care utilization, and psychosocial health self-report assessments were also employed. Results Of 413 participants randomized, 390 completed the trial. In the MBSR group, 74 experienced 112 ARI episodes with 1045 days of ARI illness. Among exercisers, 84 had 120 episodes totaling 1010 illness days. Eighty-two of the controls had 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness. Mean global severity was 315 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 244, 386), 256 (193, 318) for EX, and 336 (268, 403) for controls. A prespecified multivariate zero-inflated regression model suggested reduced incidence for MBSR (p = 0.036) and lower global severity for EX (p = 0.042), compared to control, not quite attaining the p<0.025 prespecified cut-off for null hypothesis rejection. There were 73 ARI-related missed-work days and 22 ARI-related health care visits in the MBSR group, 82 days and 21 visits for exercisers, and 105 days and 24 visits among controls. Viruses were identified in 63 ARI episodes in the MBSR group, compared to 64 for EX and 72 for control. Statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in general mental health, self-efficacy, mindful attention, sleep quality, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms were observed in the MBSR and/or EX groups, compared to control.

The aim of the present study was to explore the effects involved with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding (CREB)1 gene silencing on cognitive dysfunction through meditation of the protein kinase A (PKA)-CREB signaling pathway in mice with VD. Methods: Both the Morris water maze test and the step down test were applied to assess the cognitive function of the mice with VD. Immunohistochemical and TUNEL staining techniques were employed to evaluate the positive expression rates of the protein CREB1 and Cleaved Caspase-3, as well as neuronal apoptosis among hippocampal tissues in a respective manner. Flow cytometry was applied to determine the proliferation index and apoptosis rate of the hippocampal cells among each group. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis methods were applied to detect the expressions of cAMP, PKA and CREB in hippocampal cells. Results: Compared with the normal group, all the other groups exhibited impaired cognitive function, reduced cell numbers in the CAI area, positive expressions of CREB1 as well as positive optical density (OD) values. Furthermore, increased Cleaved Caspase-3 positive expression, OD value, proliferation index, apoptosis rate of hippocampal cells and neurons, were observed in the other groups when compared with the normal group, as well as lower expressions of cAMP, PKA and CREB1 and p-CREB1 (the shCREB1-1, H89 and shCREB1-1 + H89 groups < the VD group). Conclusion: The key findings of the present study demonstrated that CREB1 gene silencing results in aggravated VD that occurs as a result of inhibiting the PKA-CREB signaling pathway, thus exasperating cognitive dysfunction. © 2018 The Author(s).","Cognitive dysfunction; CREB; CREB1; PKA; Signaling pathway; Vascular dementia","caspase 3; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; Creb1 protein, mouse; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell count; cell proliferation; cellular parameters; cognitive defect; cognitive function test; controlled study; CREB1 gene; exploratory research; flow cytometry; gene silencing; hippocampal tissue; immunohistochemistry; male; mental test; Morris water maze test; mouse; multiinfarct dementia; neuroapoptosis; nonhuman; optical density; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein expression; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; step down test; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; animal; apoptosis; cognitive defect; gene silencing; genetics; hippocampal CA1 region; metabolism; multiinfarct dementia; nerve cell; signal transduction; Animals; Apoptosis; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Dementia, Vascular; Gene Silencing; Male; Mice; Neurons; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057235505

In order to classify the physical constitutions of infants and then investigate their hyperactivity and attention deficit or distraction, we examined infants using the Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) scale and conducted the t-test of matching samples between pre- and post-tests after color breathing and color meditation again. So we have changed not only the color of clothes suit for their physical constitutions but also colors of eating and the surrounding environment. We also made them experienced a room with blue lights for the sleeping time. The infants’ distraction was measured in the pre-test (M = 20.933, SD = 2.491) and posttest (M = 17.200, SD = 2.007). The result of the t-test showed that there was a statistically significant difference (t = 9.427, p <0.00) between pre- and post-tests for infants’ attention deficit. Therefore, it was found that the Ayurvedic color therapy program had an effect on lowering the infants’ distraction. The infants’ hyperactivity was measured in the pre-test (M = 21.400, SD = 1.638) a nd post-test (M = 17.667, SD = 1.759). It showed a significant difference (t = 12.43, p <0.001).

Mantra meditation is a ceremony that draws energy waves through sound. It is a way to heal and to self-cultivate the mind through repeated sound. It improves thought, memory and concentration, while weakening anxiety. In other words, when adolescents perform Mantra meditation in order to accomplish their learning goals, they are able to achieve better mental concentration. Repetition of sound strengthens the mind, eliminates fear and induces a feeling of emotional support. Stress responses are reduced. Motivation is induced, and self-understanding and efficiency are enhanced. This emotional stability improves concentration, diminishes distractions and helps with problem solving, ultimately leading to the achievement of learning goals.

We developed an exercise program from yoga postures with a minimal knee adduction moment for knee osteoarthritis. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of this biomechanically-based yoga exercise (YE), with traditional exercise (TE), and a no-exercise attention-equivalent control (NE) for improving pain, self-reported physical function and mobility performance in women with knee osteoarthritis. Design Single-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial. Setting Community in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Participants A convenience sample of 31 women with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis was recruited through rheumatology, orthopaedic and physiotherapy clinics, newspapers and word-of-mouth. Interventions Participants were stratified by disease severity and randomly allocated to one of three 12-week, supervised interventions. YE included biomechanically-based yoga exercises; TE included traditional leg strengthening on machines; and NE included meditation with no exercise. Participants were asked to attend three 1-hour group classes/sessions each week. Measurements Primary outcomes were pain, self-reported physical function and mobility performance. Secondary outcomes were knee strength, depression, and health-related quality of life. All were assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline and immediately following the intervention. Results The YE group demonstrated greater improvements in KOOS pain (mean difference of 22.9 [95% CI, 6.9 to 38.8; p = 0.003]), intermittent pain (mean difference of -19.6 [95% CI, -34.8 to -4.4; p = 0.009]) and self-reported physical function (mean difference of 17.2 [95% CI, 5.2 to 29.2; p = 0.003]) compared to NE. Improvements in these outcomes were similar between YE and TE. However, TE demonstrated a greater improvement in knee flexor strength compared to YE (mean difference of 0.1 [95% CI, 0.1 to 0.2]. Improvements from baseline to follow-up were present in quality of life score for YE and knee flexor strength for TE, while both also demonstrated improvements in mobility. No improvement in any outcome was present in NE. Conclusions The biomechanically-based yoga exercise program produced clinically meaningful improvements in pain, self-reported physical function and mobility in women with clinical knee OA compared to no exercise. While not statistically significant, improvements in these outcomes were larger than those elicited from the traditional exercise-based program. Though this may suggest that the yoga program may be more efficacious for knee OA, future research studying a larger sample is required. © 2018 Kuntz et al.

It is, therefore, important to ensure the physical and emotional as well as psychosocial wellbeing of individuals living with diabetes. Meditation-based strategies have been evaluated for their complementary role in several chronic disorders including depression, anxiety, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The practice of meditation is associated with reduction in stress and negative emotions and improvements in patient attitude, health-related behaviour and coping skills. There is increased parasympathetic activity with reduction in sympathetic vascular tone, stress hormones and inflammatory markers. Additionally, several studies evaluated the role of mindfulness-based stress reduction in diabetic individuals and demonstrated modest improvements in body weight, glycaemic control and blood pressure. Thus, mindfulness meditation-based intervention can lead to improvements across all domains of holistic care - biological, psychological and social. Though most of these studies have been of short duration and included small numbers of patients, meditation strategies can be useful adjunctive techniques to lifestyle modification and pharmacological management of diabetes and help improve patient wellbeing. © The Authors 2018.","Diabetes; Diabetes distress; Holistic care; Meditation; Mindfulness meditation; Mindfulness-based stress reduction; Stress reduction","anxiety; attention; body weight loss; coping behavior; depression; diabetes mellitus; distress syndrome; emotionality; exercise; glycemic control; health behavior; human; meditation; mental stress; microalbuminuria; mindfulness; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; parasympathetic tone; patient attitude; patient compliance; psychological well-being; Review; self care; self concept; stress management; transcendental meditation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047199582

Addition of Yoga Based Lifestyle Program (YLSP) to conventional cardiac rehabilitation has found useful and effective in improving ejection fraction and reducing risk factor profiles. Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of add-on YLSP to conventional post-CABG rehabilitation and to compare the changes of QOL. Materials and Methods: A total of 300 patients posted for elective CABG at Narayana Hrudayalaya Super Specialty Hospital, Bengaluru, India were randomised into two groups (150 each) i.e., Conventional Lifestyle Program (CLSP) and YLSP. Data on CLSP (95) and YLSP (102) was available for analysis at one year follow up. The YLSP Group practiced integrated yoga module including Yama, Niyama, Anasa, Pranayama and Meditation as an add-on to conventional lifestyle advice. Assessments were done before and one year after CABG on World Health Organization Quality of Life- Brief form questionnaire (WHOQOLBREF) with four domains viz., ‘Physical Health’, ‘Mental Health’, ‘Social relationships’ and ‘Environmental health’. As the data was not normally distributed, the non-parametric tests viz., Mann-Whitney Test and Wilcoxon signed ranks test for between group and within group comparisons were applied. Results: In YLSP group, significant (p<0.001; Wilcoxon’s test) improvements were found within group after one year in all domains of WHOQOL-BREF, while there was significant improvement (p<0.05; Wilcoxon’s test) only in the Social health domain, in the control (CLSP) group. There was significant differences between groups (p<0.05; Mann-Whitney test) in all domains with better improvement in the YLSP Group.

This protocol is designed to not only teach mind-body awareness but also to provide feedback utilizing physiological data and survey results. The primary findings of this study showed that heart coherence and alpha variables were significantly correlated after four weeks of the breath-based meditation stress protocol. Meditation and rhythmic breathing produced significant increases in alpha brain activity. These brain physiological responses conformed to the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) changes, suggesting the ability of the human body to enter into a meditative state and effectively manage stress. When assessed after four weeks of daily practicing the techniques employed in the stress management protocol, based on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, subjects improved in applying mindfulness skills. The overall mindfulness score, Pleth variability index (PVI), and perfusion index (PI) increased after the 4-week intervention period. Results from electroencephalography (brain waves) were consistent with a meditative state during the post-study follow-up session. This provides evidence that wearable devices are feasible for data collection during a breath-based stress management intervention. This protocol can be easily and efficiently implemented into any study design in which physiological data are desired in a non-laboratory-based setting. © 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence ofCAMuse and to identify the factors affecting CAM use in a large patient cohort seen at a comprehensive cancer center in Turkey. Patients and Methods An investigator-designed survey was completed by volunteer patients who visited the outpatient clinic in the medical oncology department. CAM use encompassed pharmacologic agents including vitamins, dietary supplements, and herbal products or nonpharmacologic methods like prayer, meditation, hypnosis, massage, or acupuncture. Results Of 1,499 patients who answered the survey, 1,433 (96%) used nonpharmacologic CAM and 60 (4%) used pharmacologic CAM (pCAM). The most frequent types of CAM used were prayer (n = 1,433) followed by herbal products (n = 42). pCAM use was not significantly associated with age (P = .63), sex (P = .15), diagnosis (P = .15), or income level (P = .09). However, it was significantly associated with the level of education (P = .0067) and employment status (P < .001). Patients with higher education levels used more pCAM products (P = .025). Among 60 pCAM users, six patients (10%) used pCAM for more than 2 years and 22 (36%) did not consult their physicians about their pCAM use. Only nine patients (15%) reported unpleasant adverse effects related to pCAM. Conclusion Although CAM use was high among our patients, prevalence of pCAM use was lower than expected. Patients with higher education levels tended to use more pCAM. © 2017 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"herbaceous agent; acupuncture; adult; alternative medicine; Article; cancer center; controlled study; diet supplementation; education; employment status; female; health survey; human; hypnosis; major clinical study; male; massage; meditation; oncology; outpatient care; prevalence; priority journal; Turkey (republic); aged; middle aged; neoplasm; questionnaire; turkey (bird); Adult; Aged; Cancer Care Facilities; Complementary Therapies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063880733

Unfortunately, the application of these treatments in milder forms of illness and subclinical samples, which affect a substantial portion of the population, is not justifiable by their costs (e.g. cognitivebehavioral therapy) and/or potential for side effects (serotonin-reuptake inhibitors associated sexual side effects). As such, there is an urgent need to develop simple yet effective treatments, such as modifiable lifestyle interventions, that can be employed on a broader scale. Here, we review the current state of evidence that supports or refutes the efficacy of lifestyle approaches for OCRDs. We focus on dimensions of lifestyle that are deemed important for cardiovascular diseases; namely, physical activity, stress, sleep, diet and eating behaviors, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Despite the relative scarcity of welldesigned randomized controlled trials targeting unhealthy life styles in OCRDs, we found meditation-based therapies and interventions focusing on eliminating sedentarism to be promising approaches. In the future, these strategies may represent valid alternative for subjects with subthreshold symptoms or at risk for OCRDs or other “compulsive” disorders. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Alcohol use; Diet; Lifestyle; Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders; Physical activity; Smoking; Stress","alcohol consumption; body dysmorphic disorder; cardiovascular disease; clinical effectiveness; diet; eating habit; feeding behavior; hoarding disorder; human; lifestyle; obsessive compulsive disorder; physical activity; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk factor; sleep; smoking; stress; cognitive behavioral therapy; drinking behavior; exercise; mental stress; obsessive compulsive disorder; serotonin uptake inhibitor; Alcohol Drinking; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Life Style; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Sleep; Smoking; Stress, Psychological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061613974

Zazen is a method of entering the meditative state. We have carried out R&D on a wearable system (earable ZEN) that casually and simply allows the subject to perform zazen without going to a temple or even having a zazen monitor present. In zazen, it is important to prepare one's breathing and posture. The earable ZEN is comprised of an earphone-type sensor (ear sensor) for measuring the breathing and posture of the user, a miniature actuator (neck belt) for communicating disturbances in the breathing and posture of the user, and a microcomputer. In an evaluation experiment, disturbance in breathing was simulated as ""deep mouth breathing"" and disturbance in posture was simulated as ""nodding"". The average accuracy value for seven healthy subjects wearing the earable ZEN was 99.9% for mouth breathing and 100% for nodding. In the same way, the average precision value was 98.7% for mouth breathing and 100% for nodding, with an average recall value of 97.1% for mouth breathing and 100% for nodding.

It is a highly prevalent medical problem across the globe and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Optimal blood glucose control is the primary goal of T2DM management. Yoga is a mind-body intervention found to be effective in various kinds of metabolic disorders including T2DM. Aim: This study intended to assess the impact of 3 months Integrated Yoga (IY) intervention on fasting and postprandial blood glucose level among patients with T2DM. Methods: Total 251 patients with T2DM within the age range of 30-60 years (with average age; 46.04 ± 14.02 years) were enrolled in the study. Participants were divided into a yoga group (n=137) and a control group (n=114). Subjects in the yoga group received IY intervention consisted of Asanas, Surynamaskara, Pranayama and meditation every day for one hour/day, 6 days in a week for three months. Control group subjects followed their daily routines. Subjects on insulin therapy, with diabetic complications, uncontrolled hypertension, under steroid medication, or previous exposure to any form of yoga were excluded from the study. Fasting and post-prandial blood glucose level were assessed before and after 3 months for both the groups. The results: Significant decrease in both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels was observed in IY group after 3 months compared to baseline. No improvement was seen in the control group.

Insomnia is common. However, no systematic reviews have examined the effect of exercise on patients with primary and secondary insomnia, defined as both sleep disruption and daytime impairment. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effectiveness/efficacy of exercise in patients with insomnia. Methods. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify all randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of exercise on various sleep parameters in patients with insomnia. All participants were diagnosed with insomnia, using standard diagnostic criteria or predetermined criteria and standard measures. Data on outcome measures were subjected to meta-analyses using random-effects models. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach were used to assess the quality of the individual studies and the body of evidence, respectively. Results. We included nine studies with a total of 557 participants. According to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (mean difference [MD], 2.87 points lower in the intervention group; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.95 points lower to 1.79 points lower; low-quality evidence) and the Insomnia Severity Index (MD, 3.22 points lower in the intervention group; 95% CI, 5.36 points lower to 1.07 points lower; very lowquality evidence), exercise was beneficial. However, exercise interventions were not associated with improved sleep efficiency (MD, 0.56% lower in the intervention group; 95% CI, 3.42% lower to 2.31% higher; moderate-quality evidence). Only four studies noted adverse effects. Most studies had a high or unclear risk of selection bias. Discussion. Our findings suggest that exercise can improve sleep quality without notable adverse effects. Most trials had a high risk of selection bias. Higher quality research is needed. © 2018 Banno et al.","Exercise; Meta-analysis; Physical activity; Sleep disorders; Systematic reviews","actimetry; Article; clinical practice; depression; disease severity; Epworth sleepiness scale; exercise; human; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; massage; meditation; meta analysis; outcome assessment; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polysomnography; quality of life; sensitivity analysis; Short Form 36; sleep parameters; sleep quality; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; systematic review; validity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049908842

To improve and facilitate formal training, beginners need to know if they are in a stable sitting posture and if they can hold it. Previous monitoring studies did not consider stability during sitting meditation or were specific for longer traditional practices. In this paper, we have extended and adapted previous studies to modern mindfulness practices and posed two questions: (a) Which is the best meditation seat for short sessions? In this way, the applications of stability measures are expanded to meditation activities, in which the sitting posture favors stability, and (b) Which is the most sensitive location of an accelerometer to measure body motion during short meditation sessions? A pilot study involving 31 volunteers was conducted using inertial sensors. The results suggest that thumb, head, or infraclavicular locations can be chosen to measure stability despite the habitual lumbar or sacral region found in the literature.

Here, we aim to develop an integrated affective neuroscience encompassing many forms of self-generated thought—normal and pathological, moderate and excessive, in waking and in sleep. In synthesizing existing literature on this topic, we reveal consistent findings pertaining to the prevalence, valence, and variability of emotion in self-generated thought, and highlight how these factors might interact with self-generated thought to influence general well-being. We integrate these psychological findings with recent neuroimaging research, bringing attention to the neural correlates of affect in self-generated thought. We show that affect in self-generated thought is prevalent, positively biased, highly variable (both within and across individuals), and consistently recruits many brain areas implicated in emotional processing, including the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. Many factors modulate these typical psychological and neural patterns, however; the emerging affective neuroscience of self-generated thought must endeavor to link brain function and subjective experience in both everyday self-generated thought as well as its dysfunctions in mental illness. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.","Mind-wandering; Rumination; Self-generated thought; Stimulus-independent thought; Task-unrelated thought","amygdala; anxiety; brain function; cognition; cognitive rumination; degenerative disease; depression; dreaming; human; insula; medial prefrontal cortex; meditation; mental disease; mindfulness; neuroimaging; neuroscience; nightmare; orbital cortex; parasomnia; prevalence; psychological well-being; Review; sleep; thinking; wakefulness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047407859

Therapeutic techniques have used conscious control and awareness of breathing for millennia with little understanding of the mechanisms underlying their efficacy. Using direct intracranial recordings in humans, we correlated cortical and limbic neuronal activity as measured by the intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) with the breathing cycle. We show this to be the direct result of neuronal activity, as demonstrated by both the specificity of the finding to the cortical gray matter and the tracking of breath by the gamma-band (40–150 Hz) envelope in these structures. We extend prior observations by showing the iEEG signal to track the breathing cycle across a widespread network of cortical and limbic structures. We further demonstrate a sensitivity of this tracking to cognitive factors by using tasks adapted from cognitive behavioral therapy and meditative practice. Specifically, volitional control and awareness of breathing engage distinct but overlapping brain circuits. During volitionally paced breathing, iEEG-breath coherence increases in a frontotemporal-insular network, and during attention to breathing, we demonstrate increased coherence in the anterior cingulate, premotor, insular, and hippocampal cortices. Our findings suggest that breathing can act as an organizing hierarchical principle for neuronal oscillations throughout the brain and detail mechanisms of how cognitive factors impact otherwise automatic neuronal processes during interoceptive attention. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Whereas the link between breathing and brain activity has a long history of application to therapy, its neurophysiology remains unexplored. Using intracranial recordings in humans, we show neuronal activity to track the breathing cycle throughout widespread cortical/limbic sites. Volitional pacing of the breath engages frontotemporal-insular cortices, whereas attention to automatic breathing modulates the cingulate cortex. Our findings imply a fundamental role of breathing-related oscillations in driving neuronal activity and provide insight into the neuronal mechanisms of interoceptive attention. © 2018 American Physiological Society.

Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness-practices on smoking are unclear. Response inhibition is a main deficit in addiction, is associated with relapse, and could therefore be a candidate target for mindfulness-based practices. The current study hence investigated the effects of a brief mindfulness-practice on response inhibition in smokers using behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) measures. Fifty participants (33 females, mean age 20 years old) underwent a protocol of cigarette exposure to induce craving (cueexposure) and were then randomly assigned to a group receiving mindfulness-instructions or control-instructions (for 15 minutes approximately). Immediately after this, they performed a smoking Go/NoGo task, while their brain activity was recorded. At the behavioral level, no group differences were observed. However, EEG analyses revealed a decrease in P3 amplitude during NoGo vs. Go trials in the mindfulness versus control group. The lower P3 amplitude might indicate less-effortful response inhibition after the mindfulness-practice, and suggest that enhanced response inhibition underlies observed positive effects of mindfulness on smoking behavior. © 2018 Andreu et al.

Various meditation techniques in use make it hard to objectively scrutinize the psychological benefits. Therefore, in this study we set out to examine the effects of two fundamentally different meditative techniques, Zazen, ‘seated meditation’, in which the body and mind are calmed, and Tai Chi, ‘meditation in motion’, based on energetic martial art performance. The aim was to compare the effects of both techniques on personality structure, emotional intelligence, mood, and coping with stress. The study was conducted in 48 healthy volunteers, aged 39–50, divided into those practicing Zazen, Tai Chi, and the non-meditating controls, each group consisting of 16 persons. The psychometric tools consisted of Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist (UMACL), Emotional Intelligence Inventory (INTE), and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). We found that both Zazen and Tai Chi meditations significantly enhanced openness to experience, one of the personality dimensions of the Big Five Model. The enhanced openness was associated with improved strategies for coping with stress. The meditators had less avoidance-oriented approaches to perceived stress. They also had improved mood compared with non-meditating controls. The findings suggest that enhanced openness to experience could shape one’s desire to hold onto the meditation regimen. We conclude that both, diametrically different types of meditation, are conducive to mental health by improving the general well-being, counteracting stress, and leading to a better vigor of spirit. Meditation may thus be considered a complimentary, albeit rather modestly acting, adjunct to psychotherapy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Coping with stress; Meditation; Mental health; Mood; Openness to experience; Personality; Psychotherapy","adult; alternative medicine; avoidance behavior; behavior; behavior assessment; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; Coping Inventory for Stressful Situation; emotion; emotional intelligence; Emotional Intelligence Inventory; female; human; human experiment; intelligence test; male; meditation; mood; NEO Five Factor Inventory; normal human; patient attitude; personal experience; personality; priority journal; psychological well-being; psychology; psychometry; psychotherapy; stress management; Tai Chi; task performance; therapy effect; University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist; Zazen; affect; coping behavior; meditation; mental stress; middle aged; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Affect; Behavior; Emotional Intelligence; Humans; Meditation; Middle Aged; Personality; Stress, Psychological",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040866363

Little is known about the active mechanisms driving these effects. We theorize that acceptance is a critical emotion regulation mechanism underlying mindfulness stress reduction effects. Method: In this three-arm parallel trial, mindfulness components were dismantled into three structurally equivalent 15-lesson smartphone-based interventions: (1) training in both monitoring and acceptance (Monitor + Accept), (2) training in monitoring only (Monitor Only), or (3) active control training (Coping control). 153 stressed adults (mean age = 32 years; 67% female; 53% white, 21.5% black, 21.5% Asian, 4% other race) were randomly assigned to complete one of three interventions. After the intervention, cortisol, blood pressure, and subjective stress reactivity were assessed using a modified Trier Social Stress Test. Results: As predicted, Monitor + Accept training reduced cortisol and systolic blood pressure reactivity compared to Monitor Only and control trainings. Participants in all three conditions reported moderate levels of subjective stress. Conclusions: This study provides the first experimental evidence that brief smartphone mindfulness training can impact stress biology, and that acceptance training drives these effects.

Many studies investigating the effects of such practices fail to include an active control group. Given the frequency with which people are selecting such interventions as a form of self-management, it is important to determine their effectiveness. Thus, this review investigates the effects of practices that include yoga asanas, with and without mindfulness-based stress reduction, compared to an active control, on physiological markers of stress. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials published in English compared practices that included yoga asanas, with and without mindfulness-based stress reduction, to an active control, on stress-related physiological measures. The review focused on studies that measured physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol and peripheral cytokine expression. MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, PubMed, and Scopus were searched in May 2016 and updated in December 2016. Randomised controlled trials were included if they assessed at least one of the following outcomes: heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability, mean arterial pressure, C-reactive protein, interleukins or cortisol. Risk of bias assessments included sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Meta-analysis was undertaken using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 3. Sensitivity analyses were performed using ‘one-study-removed’ analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted for different yoga and control group types, including mindfulness-based stress reduction versus non-mindfulness-based stress reduction based interventions, different populations, length of intervention, and method of data analysis. A random-effects model was used in all analyses. Results Forty two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Interventions that included yoga asanas were associated with reduced evening cortisol, waking cortisol, ambulatory systolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, high frequency heart rate variability, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and low density lipoprotein, compared to active control. However, the reported interventions were heterogeneous. Conclusions Practices that include yoga asanas appear to be associated with improved regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system in various populations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Exercise; Inflammation; Mindfulness-based stress reduction; Stress; Yoga","cholesterol; cytokine; glucose; hydrocortisone; low density lipoprotein; glucose; hydrocortisone; blood pressure measurement; cholesterol blood level; cytokine response; exercise; glucose blood level; heart rate variability; human; lipid blood level; meta analysis; mindfulness; outcome assessment; physiological stress; priority journal; protein expression; randomized controlled trial (topic); resting heart rate; Review; stress management; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; yoga; blood pressure; heart rate; inflammation; meditation; mental stress; metabolism; mindfulness; pathophysiology; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; yoga; Blood Pressure; Glucose; Heart Rate; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Inflammation; Meditation; Mindfulness; Stress, Psychological; Yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029927528

One is the computational model, which is based on the symbolic thinking paradigm. The other is the biological organism model. The common difficulty attributed to these paradigms is that their reductive tools allow the phenomenological aspects of experience to remain hidden behind yes/no responses (behavioral tests), or brain ‘pictures’ (neuroimaging). Hence, one of the problems regards how to overcome methodological difficulties towards a non-reductive investigation of conscious experience. It is our aim in this paper to show how cooperation between Eastern and Western traditions may shed light for a non-reductive study of mind and life. This study focuses on the first-person experience associated with cognitive and mental events. We studied phenomenal data as a crucial fact for the domain of living beings, which, we expect, can provide the ground for a subsequent third-person study. The intervention with Jhana meditation, and its qualitative assessment, provided us with experiential profiles based upon subjects’ evaluations of their own conscious experiences. The overall results should move towards an integrated or global perspective on mind where neither experience nor external mechanisms have the final word. © 2017","Autopoiesis; Conscious experience; Meditation; Mind-life continuity thesis; Qualitative study","brain; consciousness; human; life; neurobiology; physiology; procedures; Brain; Consciousness; Humans; Life; Neurobiology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029703189

One proposed pathway for the positive effects of mindfulness training is through the development of new emotion regulation strategies, such as the ability to experience emotions by observing and accepting them without judgment. Theoretically, this should facilitate recovery from negative emotional states; however, this has rarely been examined empirically. The goal of the current study was to determine whether mindfulness training is associated with more efficient emotional and cardiovascular recovery from induced negative affect. Methods The current study tested emotional and cardiovascular recovery from induced negative affect during a personal recall task in women randomly assigned to 6-weeks of mindfulness training (n = 39) compared to women assigned to a wait-list control condition (n = 32). During baseline, task, and post-task rest, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored at fixed intervals and heart rate variability (HRV) and pre-ejection period (PEP) were monitored continuously. This study was embedded within a randomized trial that evaluated the effects of mindfulness training in a sample of younger breast cancer survivors, a group in need of access to effective psychosocial intervention as they can experience high stress, anxiety, and physical symptoms for many years in to survivorship. Results In response to the personal recall task, women in both the intervention and control groups showed significant increases in sadness, anxiety, and anger, with the intervention group reaching higher levels of sadness and anger than controls. Further, the intervention group showed a significantly steeper decline in sadness and anger, as well as steeper initial decline in diastolic blood pressure compared to women in the wait list control condition. Groups did not differ in their self-reported feelings of anxiety, or in blood pressure, heart rate, or pre-ejection period (PEP) responses to the task. The control group demonstrated an increase in heart rate variability (HRV) during the task (indexed by the root mean square of successive differences in heart rate; RMSSD) while the intervention group remained flat throughout the task. Conclusion Compared to the control group, women in the intervention group experienced greater negative emotions when recalling a difficult experience related to their breast cancer, and demonstrated an efficient emotional and blood pressure recovery from the experience. This suggests that mindfulness training may lead to an enhanced emotional experience coupled with the ability to recovery quickly from negative emotional states. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer survivorship; Cardiovascular health; Emotion regulation; Mindfulness meditation; Stress reactivity","adult; anger; anxiety; Article; blood pressure monitoring; cancer survivor; cardiovascular function; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; emotion; female; heart preejection period; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; middle aged; mindfulness; negative feedback; physiological process; priority journal; psychosocial care; randomized controlled trial; sadness; stress; visual perception test; affect; blood pressure; case control study; emotion; heart rate; meditation; mental stress; mindfulness; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; Adult; Affect; Anxiety; Blood Pressure; Case-Control Studies; Emotions; Expressed Emotion; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029347824

A model of the subject with reflexion and capable for meditation is constructed. The processes of reflexion and meditation are presented as the sequence of heat engines. Each subsequent engine compensates for the imperfectness of the preceding engine by performing work equal to the lost available work of the preceding one. The sequence of heat engines is regarded as a chain of the subject's mental images of the self. Each engine can be interpreted as an image of the self that the engine next to it has, and the work performed by engines as the emotions that the subject and his images are experiencing. Two types of meditation are analyzed: The dissolution in nothingness and union with the Absolute. In the first type, the initial engine is the one that yields heat to the coldest reservoir, and in the second type, the initial engine is the one that takes heat from the hottest reservoir.

One of the most effective prevention mechanisms against dementia lies in increasing brain- and cognitive-reserve capacity, which has been found to reduce the behavioral severity of dementia symptoms as neurological degeneration progresses. To date though, most of the factors known to enhance this reserve stem from largely immutable history factors, such as level of education and occupational attainment. Here, we review the potential for basic lifestyle activities, including physical exercise, meditation and musical experience, to contribute to reserve capacity and thus reduce the incidence of dementia in older adults. Relative to other therapies, these activities are low cost, are easily scalable and can be brought to market quickly and easily. Overall, although preliminary evidence is promising at the level of randomized control trials, the state of research on this topic remains underdeveloped. As a result, several important questions remain unanswered, including the amount of training required to receive any cognitive benefit from these activities and the extent to which this benefit continues following cessation. Future research directions are discussed for each lifestyle activity, as well as the potential for these and other lifestyle activities to serve as both a prophylactic and a therapeutic treatment for dementia. © 2017 Christie, Hamilton, Manor, Farb, Farzan, Sixsmith, Temprado and Moreno.","Aging; Cognitive health; Dementia; Lifestyle factors; Neuroplasticity","aging; cognitive defect; dementia; exercise; human; incidence; lifestyle; meditation; music therapy; Review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034635868

One approach for helping people cope with the inherent stress of cancer is through the use of mind-body therapies (MBTs) such as mediation, yoga, hypnosis, relaxation, and imagery, which harness the power of the mind to affect physical and psychological symptoms. One group of MBTs with a growing body of research evidence to support their efficacy focus on training in mindfulness meditation; these are collectively known as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). Research supports the role of MBIs for dealing with common experiences that cause distress around cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship including loss of control, uncertainty about the future, fears of recurrence, and a range of physical and psychological symptoms including depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue. Growing research also supports their cost-effectiveness, and online and mobile adaptations currently being developed and evaluated increase promise for use in a global context. © The Author 2017.

We evaluated the growth of integrative medicine in leading academic cancer centers in the United States as reflected by their public-facing websites. Methods: We performed a systematic review of 45 National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer center websites. Two researchers independently evaluated whether the websites provided information regarding integrative medicine modalities and, if so, whether the services were provided in the same health system. They compared the proportion of cancer centers providing the information on each modality in 2016 with the data from the prior study in 2009. Results: The most common integrative medicine therapies mentioned on the 45 NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center websites were exercise (97.8%) and acupuncture and meditation (88.9% each), followed by yoga (86.7%), massage (84.4%), and music therapy (82.2%). The majority of the websites also provided information on nutrition (95.6%), dietary supplements (93.3%), and herbs (88.9%). The most common therapies offered in the health systems were acupuncture/massage (73.3% each), meditation/yoga (68.9% each), and consultations about nutrition (91.1%), dietary supplements (84.4%), and herbs (66.7%). Compared with 2009, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of websites mentioning acupuncture, dance therapy, healing touch, hypnosis, massage, meditation, Qigong, and yoga (all P <.05). Conclusions: Leading US cancer centers increasingly present integrative medicine content on their websites, and the majority of them provide these services to patients in the same health systems. © The Author 2017.

While therapy of treatment-related disability mostly succeeds a cancer-specific treatment, physicians' awareness of simultaneous supportive therapy is rising. Early interventions such as physical exercise during chemotherapy are effective in reducing conditions such as fatigue. Specific sensorimotor training is able to improve or even prevent impairment of balance caused by neurotoxic agents. Although targeted therapies reduce the risk of side effects, combinations with established drugs have to be monitored with regard to cardiotoxicity, which is already a concern in children's cancer therapy and is now also focused on in long-term adult survivors. Improvement in diagnosis und surgical procedures have reduced impairments such as lymphedema. Furthermore, management and quality of life of breast cancer patients benefit from evidence showing that physical exercise and resistance training do not increase the risk of developing lymphedema. © 2017 S.

Using the Illumina 450 K array platform, we analyzed the DNA methylome from blood cells of long-term meditators and meditation-naïve controls to estimate their Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), using Horvath's calculator. IEAA was similar in both groups. However, controls showed a different IEAA trajectory with aging than meditators: older controls (age ≥ 52) had significantly higher IEAAs compared with younger controls (age <52), while meditators were protected from this epigenetic aging effect. Notably, in the meditation group, we found a significant negative correlation between IEAA and the number of years of regular meditation practice. From our results, we hypothesize that the cumulative effects of a regular meditation practice may, in the long-term, help to slow the epigenetic clock and could represent a useful preventive strategy for age-related chronic diseases.

The study examined whether self-esteem mediated the effects of yoga on quality of life, fatigue and menopausal symptoms, utilizing validated outcome measures. Study design This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of yoga with those of usual care in 40 breast cancer survivors who suffered from menopausal symptoms. All participants completed all 3 assessments (week 0, week 12, and week 24) and provided full data. Main outcome measures Outcomes were measured using self-rating instruments. Mediation analyses were performed using SPSS. Results Self-esteem mediated the effect of yoga on total menopausal symptoms (B = −2.11, 95% BCI [−5.40 to −0.37]), psychological menopausal symptoms (B = −0.94, 95% BCI [−2.30 to −0.01]), and urogenital menopausal symptoms (B = −0.66, 95% BCI [−1.65 to −0.15]), quality of life (B = 8.04, 95% BCI [3.15–17.03]), social well-being (B = 1.80, 95% BCI [0.54–4.21]), emotional well-being (B = 1.62, 95% BCI [0.70–3.34]), functional well-being (B = 1.84, 95% BCI [0.59–4.13]), and fatigue (B = 4.34, 95% BCI [1.28–9.55]).

The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore how spirituality and religion can be leveraged in the design of community-based physical activity programs for African American women delivered outside of faith-based or faith-placed settings. Results: Three focus groups were conducted were conducted with 23 African American women (M age = 37.8 years, M BMI = 39.6 kg m2). Results showed that incorporating aspects of spirituality (i.e., words encouraging connectedness to a higher power, meditation, mind-body activities) into a physical activity program was universally accepted among participants, regardless of religious affiliation. In contrast, including concepts of religion (i.e., bible verses and/or quotes from religious leaders) was controversial and not recommended among women who did not identify with a religious faith. Findings indicate that when developing community-based physical activity interventions that will not be delivered through faith-based or faith-placed settings, researchers should avoid references to specific religious beliefs. Instead, interventions should focus on spirituality and emphasize the mind-body relationship between physical activity and an African American women's inner-being and her connectedness with a higher power. © 2017 The Author(s).","Black; Exercise; Physical activity; Religion; Spirituality; Women","adult; African American; clinical trial; community care; ethnology; female; human; kinesiotherapy; middle aged; obesity; procedures; program development; psychology; qualitative research; religion; standards; Adult; African Americans; Community Health Services; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Obesity; Program Development; Qualitative Research; Spirituality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032016298

Methods: The following databases were used to conduct a systematic review: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and Scielo. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated RSIs regarding physical health outcomes and/or quality of life in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. RSI protocols performed at a distance (i.e. intercessory prayer) or for psychiatric disorders were excluded. This study consisted of two phases: (a) reading titles and abstracts, and (b) assessing the full articles and their methodological quality using the Cochrane Back Review Group scale. Results: In total, 7,070 articles were identified in the search, but 6884 were excluded in phase 1 because they were off topic or repeated in databases. Among the 186 articles included in phase 2, 140 were excluded because they did not fit the inclusion criteria and 16 did not have adequate randomization process. Thus, a final selection of 30 articles remained. The participants of the selected studies were classified in three groups: chronic patients (e.g., cancer, obesity, pain), healthy individuals and healthcare professionals. The outcomes assessed included quality of life, physical activity, pain, cardiac outcomes, promotion of health behaviors, clinical practice of healthcare professionals and satisfaction with protocols. The divergence concerning scales and protocols proposed did not allow a meta-analysis. RSIs as a psychotherapy approach were performed in 40% of the studies, and the control group was more likely to use an educational intervention (56.7%). The results revealed small effect sizes favoring RSIs in quality of life and pain outcomes and very small effects sizes in physical activity, promotion of health behaviors and clinical practice of health professionals compared with other complementary strategies. Other outcomes, such as cardiac measures and satisfaction with the protocols, revealed no evidence for RSIs. Regarding the quality of the selected articles according to the Cochrane Back Review Group Scale, the average score was 6.83 (SD = 9.08) on a scale of 11, demonstrating robustness in the studies. Conclusion: Clinical trials on RSIs demonstrated that they had small benefits compared with other complementary health therapies by reducing pain and weight, improving quality of life and promoting health behaviors. The lack of clinical trials that included biological outcomes and the diversity of approaches indicate a need for more studies to understand the possible mechanisms of action of RSIs and their roles in health care. © 2017 Gonçalves et al.

METHODS: A mindfulness, attention-control, or resting exposure was assigned to 57 English- or Spanish-speaking colorectal cancer patients at 1 county oncology clinic and 1 university oncology clinic at the start of chemotherapy. Saliva samples were collected at the start of chemotherapy and at subsequent 20-minute intervals during the first 60 minutes of chemotherapy (4 samples in all). Self-reporting on biobehavioral assessments after chemotherapy included distress, fatigue, and mindfulness. RESULTS: An area-under-the-curve analysis (AUC) showed a relative increase in cortisol reactivity in the mindfulness group after adjustments for biological and clinical measures (β = 123.21; P =.03). More than twice as many patients in the mindfulness group versus the controls displayed a cortisol rise from the baseline to 20 minutes (69% vs 34%; P =.02). AUC values were uncorrelated with biobehavioral measure scores, although mindfulness scores were inversely correlated with fatigue (r = –0.46; P <.01) and distress scores (r = –0.54; P <.01). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that mindfulness practice during chemotherapy can reduce the blunting of neuroendocrine profiles typically observed in cancer patients. Implications include support for the use of mindfulness practice in integrative oncology.

Here, we evaluated whether TCC is noninferior to CBT-I for the treatment of insomnia in survivors of breast cancer. Patients and Methods This was a randomized, partially blinded, noninferiority trial that involved survivors of breast cancer with insomnia who were recruited from the Los Angeles community from April 2008 to July 2012. After a 2-month phase-in period with repeated baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to 3 months of CBT-I or TCC and evaluated at months 2, 3 (post-treatment), 6, and 15 (follow-up). Primary outcome was insomnia treatment response—that is, marked clinical improvement of symptoms by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index—at 15 months. Secondary outcomes were clinician-assessed remission of insomnia; sleep quality; total sleep time, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and awake after sleep onset, derived from sleep diaries; polysomnography; and symptoms of fatigue, sleepiness, and depression. Results Of 145 participants who were screened, 90 were randomly assigned (CBT-I: n = 45; TCC: n = 45). The proportion of participants who showed insomnia treatment response at 15 months was 43.7% and 46.7% in CBT-I and TCC, respectively. Tests of noninferiority showed that TCC was noninferior to CBT-I at 15 months (P = .02) and at months 3 (P = .02) and 6 (P, .01). For secondary outcomes, insomnia remission was 46.2% and 37.9% in CBT-I and TCC, respectively. CBT-I and TCC groups showed robust improvements in sleep quality, sleep diary measures, and related symptoms (all P, .01), but not polysomnography, with similar improvements in both groups. Conclusion CBT-I and TCC produce clinically meaningful improvements in insomnia. TCC, a mindful movement meditation, was found to be statistically noninferior to CBT-I, the gold standard for behavioral treatment of insomnia. Copyright © 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

The opinions of experts in the field of mental health have taken to frame a trans-disciplinary intervention for adolescent girls on self awareness. Aim: To discuss the development and validation of a structured intervention by combining the knowledge from different disciplines in helping adolescents enhancing self awareness. Materials and Methods: Both qualitative and quantitative methodologies were followed for the development and validation of the module. First phase of the development of intervention module was the framing of intervention module after conducting in-depth interviews with experts in both mental health and yoga fields. Six experts each from mental health and yoga field were chosen experts for interview through convenient sampling. Validated interview guides were used for the process. The framed intervention module was given to six mental health experts and six yoga experts for content validation. The experts rated the usefulness of the intervention on a scale 0-4 (4=extremely helpful). Results: The themes derived in the interviews were importance of self awareness, autonomy of self, physical level of self understanding, self regulation of emotions and self monitoring. The interviews were consolidated to frame the intervention module consisting of eight sessions having two parts in each session. Part one of each session is activities and interactions on mental health and part two is guided instructions for body focused meditation. Sessions were finalized with rating and suggestions from the experts. The final version of the module was pilot tested and had found to have enhanced self awareness among adolescent girls. Conclusion: Integration of multiple disciplines brought in novel perspectives in intervention. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Normal aging, on the other hand, has also been associated with structural and functional brain changes, but these generally involve decreased cognitive functions. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare brain cortical thickness (CT) in elderly yoga practitioners and a group of age-matched healthy non-practitioners. We tested 21 older women who had practiced hatha yoga for at least 8 years and 21 women naive to yoga, meditation or any mind-body interventions who were matched to the first group in age, years of formal education and physical activity level. A T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence was acquired for each participant. Yoga practitioners showed significantly greater CT in a left prefrontal lobe cluster, which included portions of the lateral middle frontal gyrus, anterior superior frontal gyrus and dorsal superior frontal gyrus. We found greater CT in the left prefrontal cortex of healthy elderly women who trained yoga for a minimum of 8 years compared with women in the control group. © 2017 Afonso, Balardin, Lazar, Sato, Igarashi, Santaella, Lacerda, Amaro and Kozasa.","Aging; Cortical thickness; Meditation; MRI; Prefrontal cortex; Yoga","aged; aging; clinical article; control group; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); cross-sectional study; dorsal region; education; female; human; middle frontal gyrus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical activity; physician; prefrontal cortex; superior frontal gyrus; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020851535

Here, our Authors use a combination of electroencephalography*(EEG) and electrocardiography*(ECG) to investigate traditional spiritual stress-reduction techniques. Examining the EEG and ECG's of participants before and after an 8-week Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction course, the authors recorded changes in the wavelet entropy of these data based on the training level or meditation type used. This provides a quantifiable methodology for the study of the effects of mindfulness training on the links between the brain and the heart. This slides nicely into our next highlighted article on another heart- and brain- healthy subject - fish oils. In JoVE Chemistry, our Authors present a protocol for the rapid evaluation of the lipid profiles in fish oil supplements. Using high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, individual fatty acids can be identified, as well as their positional distribution on the glycerol backbone. This method is a powerful analytical tool for the screening encapsulated supplements, and can help protect consumers from any ""fishy"" products… From wellness and fish oils to well-oiled fish, our next article in JoVE Biology looks at the effects of alcohol exposure on zebrafish. To investigate Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD)*, our Authors exposed zebrafish larvae to acute ethanol treatment, and then visualized their livers using a specifically optimized Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)* staining protocol. The authors show that steatosis and swelling of the hepatic blood vessels is apparent after just 24 hours of exposure to high ethanol levels. This versatile protocol can also be applied to other models of toxin- and virusinduced injury in the increasingly used zebrafish liver model. Finally this month, let's chill out with a novel freezing method from JoVE Biology. Here, our Authors present time-resolved electron microscopy, dubbed ""flash-and-freeze"", which gives a snapshot of membrane dynamics on the order of milliseconds and nanometers. The ""flash"" is an optogenetic stimulation of neuronal activity, and induces neurotransmitter release. A high-pressure ""freeze"" then swiftly preserves the cells at the resultant stages, allowing researchers to follow morphological changes after synaptic transmission. That's super cool!

Sikhism is a young and vibrant religion, spread across the world and the Holy Scripture Sri Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS) is regarded as the living Guru by all Sikhs. The three key pillars of Sikhism are Kirat Karni (honest living), Vand Chakna (sharing with others) and Naam Japna (focus on God). They can help encourage the diabetes care provider, patient and community to engage in lifestyle modification, shared responsibility, positive thinking and stress management. The verses (Sabads) from the SGGS, with their timeless relevance, span the entire spectrum of diabetes care, from primordial and primary, to secondary and tertiary prevention. They can provide us with guidance towards a holistic approach towards health and lifestyle related diseases as diabetes. The SGGS suggests that good actions are based on one's body and highlights the relevance of mind-body interactions and entraining the mind to cultivate healthy living habits. The ethics of sharing, community and inclusiveness all lay emphasis on the need for global and unified efforts to manage and reduce the burden of the diabetes pandemic. © 2017 Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism.","Diabetes; meditation; self-care; Sikhism; Sri Guru Granth Sahib","alcohol consumption; attitude to health; diabetes mellitus; drug dependence; healthy diet; healthy lifestyle; holistic care; human; meditation; motivation; philosophy; physical activity; religion; Review; self care; Sikhism; smoking; stress management; tobacco consumption; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019115832

This narrative review aims to expand providers’ understanding of cross-cultural approaches to treating and managing menopause by providing an overarching framework and perspective on CAM treatments. Increased provider understanding and awareness may improve not only provider-patient communication but also effectiveness of treatments. The distinction between illness (what patients suffer) and disease (what physicians treat) highlights the gap between what patients seek and doctors provide, and may help clarify why many women seek CAM at menopause. For example, CAM is often sought by women for whom biomedicine has been unsuccessful or inaccessible. We review the relevance to menopause of three CAM categories: natural products, mind–body practices including meditation, and other complementary health approaches including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Japanese Kampo. Assessing the effectiveness of CAM is challenging because of the individualized nature of illness patterns and associated treatments, which complicate the design of randomized controlled trials. Because many women seek CAM due to inefficacy of biomedical treatments, or cultural or economic marginalization, biomedical practitioners who make an effort to learn about CAM and ask patients about their CAM use or interest may dramatically improve the patient-provider relationship and rapport, as well as harnessing the ‘meaning response’ (Moerman, 2002) imbued in the clinical encounter. By working with women to integrate their CAM-related health-seeking behaviors and treatments, providers may also boost the efficacy of their own biomedical treatments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); Japanese Kampo medicine; Menopause; Mind-body practices; Natural products; Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)","estrogen; follitropin; kampo; phytoestrogen; alternative medicine; Chinese medicine; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; evidence based medicine; female; health status; help seeking behavior; human; life cycle; meditation; menopause; placebo effect; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; Chinese medicine; health behavior; interpersonal communication; Communication; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Menopause; Mind-Body Therapies",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014502559

This communication briefly reports upon the neurological manifestations that arise including the weakness of the ligaments of the craniocervical junction and spine, early disc degeneration, and the weakness of the epineurium and perineurium surrounding peripheral nerves. Entrapment, deformation, and biophysical deformative stresses exerted upon the nervous system may alter gene expression, neuronal function and phenotypic expression. This report also discusses increased prevalence of migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Tarlov cysts, tethered cord syndrome, and dystonia, where associations with EDS have been anecdotally reported, but where epidemiological evidence is not yet available. Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI) has been reported to be a comorbid condition to EDS, and may be complicated by craniocervical instability or basilar invagination. Motor delay, headache, and quadriparesis have been attributed to ligamentous laxity and instability at the atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints, which may complicate all forms of EDS. Discopathy and early degenerative spondylotic disease manifest by spinal segmental instability and kyphosis, rendering EDS patients prone to mechanical pain, and myelopathy. Musculoskeletal pain starts early, is chronic and debilitating, and the neuromuscular disease of EDS manifests symptomatically with weakness, myalgia, easy fatigability, limited walking, reduction of vibration sense, and mild impairment of mobility and daily activities. Consensus criteria and clinical practice guidelines, based upon stronger epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence, are needed to refine diagnosis and treatment of the various neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","atlantoaxial instability; craniocervical instability; Ehlers–Danlos syndrome; headache; tethered cord syndrome","acetazolamide; botulinum toxin; caffeine; triptan derivative; acupuncture; Arnold Chiari malformation; atlantoaxial instability; bariatric surgery; brain surgery; cervical collar; craniocervical instability; dystonia; Ehlers Danlos syndrome; human; idiopathic intracranial hypertension; kyphosis; lifestyle modification; meditation; migraine; motor dysfunction; neurologic disease; neuromuscular disease; pathogenesis; physical examination; physiotherapy; prevalence; Review; spine disease; spine surgery; Tarlov cyst; tethered cord syndrome; comorbidity; complication; Ehlers Danlos syndrome; musculoskeletal pain; Nervous System Diseases; pathology; pathophysiology; practice guideline; Spinal Diseases; Comorbidity; Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome; Humans; Musculoskeletal Pain; Nervous System Diseases; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Spinal Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013484185

The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the impact of mindfulness training on three areas of functioning in older adults: behavioral and neural correlates of attentional performance, psychological well-being, and systemic inflammation. We have previously proposed that mindfulness training is uniquely suited as a rehabilitative tool for conferring both cognitive and emotional benefits for older adults. Specifically, mindfulness training's promotion of focused attention may mitigate the decline of attentional control abilities across late development and allow older adults to capitalize on their preserved emotion regulation abilities. Existing evidence points to some improvements in facets of attentional control in older adults, although some studies have shown no benefits in performance. Further, there is evidence of enhancements in both psychological and physical aspects of well-being, and accompanying improvements in systemic inflammation, following mindfulness training. The scientific investigation of mindfulness training is still relatively nascent, with only a limited number of studies, particularly randomized controlled trials utilizing active comparison conditions. It will be important for future research to incorporate placebo-controlled comparison groups to clearly establish the causal role of mindfulness practices in promoting holistic health in older adults. © 2017 Fountain-Zaragoza and Prakash.","Attentional control; Healthy aging; Mindfulness training; Psychological well-being; Systemic inflammation","age; aging; alertness; anxiety; attention; chronic pain; cognitive defect; cognitive therapy; depression; emotional stress; emotionality; executive function; human; inflammation; low back pain; meditation; mental performance; mindfulness; psychological well-being; Review; selective attention; sleep disorder; therapy effect",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014520428

The paucity of studies meant that most recommendations were 'expert opinion'. Methods A multidisciplinary group from 12 countries assessed evidence with a focus on systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerned with pharmacological/nonpharmacological management for fibromyalgia. A review, in May 2015, identified eligible publications and key outcomes assessed were pain, fatigue, sleep and daily functioning. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used for making recommendations. Results 2979 titles were identified: from these 275 full papers were selected for review and 107 reviews (and/or meta-analyses) evaluated as eligible. Based on metaanalyses, the only 'strong for' therapy-based recommendation in the guidelines was exercise. Based on expert opinion, a graduated approach, the following four main stages are suggested underpinned by shared decision-making with patients. Initial management should involve patient education and focus on nonpharmacological therapies. In case of non-response, further therapies (all of which were evaluated as 'weak for' based on meta-analyses) should be tailored to the specific needs of the individual and may involve psychological therapies (for mood disorders and unhelpful coping strategies), pharmacotherapy (for severe pain or sleep disturbance) and/or a multimodal rehabilitation programme (for severe disability). Conclusions These recommendations are underpinned by high-quality reviews and meta-analyses. The size of effect for most treatments is relatively modest. We propose research priorities clarifying who will benefit from specific interventions, their effect in combination and organisation of healthcare systems to optimise outcome. ©The Author(s) 2017.",,"amitriptyline; anticonvulsive agent; capsaicin; citalopram; cyclobenzaprine; duloxetine; fluoxetine; growth hormone; ibuprofen; moclobemide; monoamine oxidase inhibitor; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; oxybate sodium; paracetamol plus tramadol; paroxetine; pirlindole; pregabalin; s adenosylmethionine; serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; tenoxicam; tramadol; agents acting on the peripheral nervous and neuromuscular systems; cyclobenzaprine; human growth hormone; tricyclic antidepressant agent; acupuncture; alternative medicine; Article; chiropractic; cognitive behavioral therapy; coping behavior; daily life activity; disease classification; evidence based medicine; exercise; fatigue; fibromyalgia; human; hydrotherapy; hypnosis; massage; medical expert; medical literature; meditation; meta analysis (topic); mindfulness; mood disorder; outcome assessment; pain; patient decision making; patient education; practice guideline; psychotherapy; sleep; systematic review (topic); treatment response; analogs and derivatives; biofeedback; chiropractic manipulation; cognitive therapy; daily life activity; Europe; fatigue; fibromyalgia; kinesiotherapy; medical society; pathophysiology; sleep; treatment outcome; Activities of Daily Living; Acupuncture Therapy; Amitriptyline; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Anticonvulsants; Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; Biofeedback, Psychology; Capsaicin; Cognitive Therapy; Europe; Evidence-Based Medicine; Exercise Therapy; Fatigue; Fibromyalgia; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Hydrotherapy; Hypnosis; Manipulation, Chiropractic; Massage; Mind-Body Therapies; Mindfulness; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; Pain; Practice Guidelines as Topic; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sensory System Agents; Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors; Sleep; Societies, Medical; Sodium Oxybate; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977488181

Effect of meditation on various domains of cognition in aging and patients at risk of dementia is receiving growing attention. The potential of mindfulness to reduce, slow down or prevent cognitive decline in patients with high risk of developing dementia is a curious topic of discussion with vast clinical implications. However, the effect of Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) on cognitive functions in patients with cognitive decline is very poorly understood. Aim. The aim of this study was to examine effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on cognitive functions in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods. 14 MCI patients participated in the program. The severity of their cognitive decline was assessed by CogState cognitive tests. Results. Results showed that, when comparing values before and after completing MBSR, MCI patients significantly improved in cognitive task assessing psychomotor functions, but not in tasks assessing attention, visual learning, or working memory. Conclusion. Data suggest that mindfulness may positively influence certain cognitive domains in MCI patients. However, further studies with larger sample size, follow-up data and active control group are needed. © 2017, PALACKY UNIV.

Thus, the effect of yoga which comprises pranayama, asana, and meditation is more relaxing than the well-equipped gym schools of today which are very lucrative and attractive, but they are costly means of fitness. Yogic exercises are more relaxing and cost effective. Aims and Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare and see the effect of treadmill exercise and yoga on oxidative stress. Materials and Methods: An observational study was conducted in Exercise Physiology Laboratory, Department of Physiology (Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Sawangi Meghe, Wardha, Maharashtra, India). 50 male subjects of age group 18-20 years, were divided into two groups, treadmill exercise (Group A) and yoga (Group B) consisting of 25 each. On regular exercise, subjects were assessed at the start of and after 3 months of the training schedule (45 min/5 days/week). Blood samples were collected to assess the MDA levels before and after the intervention. The parameter assessed were vital parameters (heart rate and pulse rate), VO2 max; they were also assessed for their social and environmental behavior by WHO-quality of life questionnaire. Results were compared using Student paired t-test and unpaired t-test and age-wise distribution by Chi-square test. Result: Results showed that the pre-exercise levels of MDA in Group A (1.30 ± 0.1) and Group B (1.23 ± 0.1) and the postexercise levels in Group A (0.92 ± 0.2) and Group B (0.37 ± 0.2). There was an increase in the vital parameter in Group A, whereas no significant changes were observed in Group B. VO2max levels state that the oxygen requirement is more for Group A than Group B. Conclusion: The study concludes that yoga has more beneficial effect than the treadmill exercise which helps to decrease the free radical production. © 2017 Rucha Wagh, et al.","Free radicals; Malondialdehyde; Oxidative stress; Treadmill exercise and yoga","free radical; malonaldehyde; adult; Article; blood sampling; body mass; clinical article; comparative effectiveness; cost effectiveness analysis; exercise; heart muscle injury; heart rate; human; intervention study; male; observational study; oxidative stress; patient selection; pulse rate; quality of life; questionnaire; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032907504

Yoga modulates the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary axis to decrease the effects of stress. Increase in cardiac output (CO) within physiological limits has health benefits. Aims and Objective: We compared the alteration in CO in subjects practicing yoga and those not practicing yoga before and after exposure to an exercise challenge. Materials and Methods: A total of 94 healthy male subjects in the age group 20 to 60 years were included in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups. Yoga group (n = 47, mean age: 43.95 ± 6.61 years, mean body mass index (BMI): 24.09 ± 4.19 kg/m2) consisted of subjects who had practiced yoga (Asanas, Pranayama, and meditation) for over 2 years. Nonyoga group (n = 47, mean age: 44.17 ± 6.48 years, mean BMI: 24.33 ± 4.97 kg/m2) did not perform yoga or any other form of regular physical activity for the same duration. CO was measured using non-invasive CO monitor of L and T systems. Results: CO before exercise in yoga and non-yoga groups was 4.21 ± 0.63 L/min and 4.08 ± 0.57 L/min, respectively. The values of CO after exercise in yoga and non-yoga groups were 5.71 ± 0.58 L/min and 4.94 ± 0.53 L/min, respectively. CO after exercise challenge and difference in change of CO was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) between the two groups. CO was significantly increased in yoga group after exercise but not in nonyoga group. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in CO after exercise in practitioners of yoga indicating an increase in cardiovascular endurance in practitioners of yoga. © 2016 Ambarish Vijayaraghava et al.","Cardiac output; Exercise; Physical stress; Yoga","adult; Article; body mass; comparative study; controlled study; heart output; human; male; normal human; physical activity; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020480657

It is not a disease. Most of the age-related functional changes in the respiratory system result from three physiologic events-progressive decreases in the compliance of the chest wall, in the static elastic recoil of the lung, and in the strength of respiratory muscles. Meditation by the Sahaja yoga technique is, according to tradition, an innately therapeutic process, which is beneficial for all chronic diseases, mental or physical, including asthma. Aims and Objectives: To evaluate and compare the effect of Sahaja yoga meditation on pulmonary functions in subjects aged older than 40 years before and after the practice of Sahaja yoga meditation and to correlate pulmonary function test (PFT) parameters with age. Materials and Methods: The study included 100 subjects (50 male and 50 female subjects) aged older than 40 years who were selected from Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College campus and Wardha city. PFTs were carried out on all subjects, and Sahaja yoga meditation training was given, and all of them were advised to practice Sahaja yoga for 6 months. Statistical analysis was done using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: The mean FEV1% predicted increased from 65.55% ± 26.76% to 82.30% ± 29.81%. The forced vital capacity (FVC) % predicted increased from 75.76% ± 30.78% to 85.90% ± 30.49% at the posttest. The mean FEV1/FVC ratio was 0.93 ± 0.40 and 0.94 ± 0.11 at the pre- and posttest, respectively. All the parameters except peak expiratory flow rate were significantly negatively correlated with age. All the PFT parameters significantly increased at the posttest. Conclusion: Sahaja yoga meditation aims to promote the experience of “thoughtless awareness.” Age-related decline in respiratory functions can be modified by the daily practice of Sahaja yoga meditation, which is specifically convenient in elderly individuals to prevent the risk of pulmonary diseases related to age. © 2016 Monica S Yunati et al.","Aging; Pulmonary functions; Sahaja yoga meditation","adult; aged; aging; Article; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; lung function; lung function test; male; normal human; peak expiratory flow; spirometry; total lung capacity; training; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020438705

Baroreceptor stimulation by means of slow deep breathing (SDB) can be used as a clinically useful intervention for pain modulation. SDB is the basic component of ‘Pranayama’ (breath control) and ‘Dhyana’ (meditation). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SDB decreases pain perception and increases cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity. Methods: In 30 healthy participants, pain-threshold and pain-tolerance were assessed before and after SDB (6 breathes/minutes for 5 minutes). Exposure to cold water (5ºC) was used for pain induction. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and continuous blood pressure (BP) were recorded using Biopac MP150 (BIOPAC Systems Inc., USA). These signals were analyzed using the Nevrokard(version 6.4.0 Slovenia). Results: Pain tolerance was high after SDB (p=0.008) as compared to spontaneous breathing. The pain-threshold showed no difference. Heart rate variability (HRV) measures of parasympathetic activity, such as standard deviation of the R–R intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences between adjacent R–R intervals (RMSSD) were higher during SDB than during spontaneous breathing (both p<0.05). Low frequency (LF) power was high (p=0.001) and high frequency (HF) power was low (p=0.003) during SDB than spontaneous breathing. LF α-index BRS was high during SDB (p=0.03). Discussion: Our study shows that pain-tolerance increases after SDB which could be due to modulation of autonomic nervous system. However, the small magnitude of changes in pain perception suggests that factors other than autonomic control may underlie the effects of breathing techniques on pain modulation. © 2017, Association of Physiologists and Pharmacologists of India.

Many psychological and behavioural aspects of meditation help to understand the effects of meditation qualitatively. Reaction time (RT) being one such measure estimates the response of central nervous system. It serves as a simple non invasive method to measure level of alertness providing an efficiency index of central nervous system processing. Method: Choice reaction time was used in the present investigation to study the impact of meditation “Dialogue with the Body” on 45 young healthy volunteers who practised the technique regularly for 12 weeks. The auditory and visual RT was measured at the intervals of 45 days and 90 days using RT analyser and data analysis was done using SPSS. Results: Repeated ANOVA measures and least square difference comparison were used for analysis. The results obtained show significant difference (p<0.05) in both auditory and visual reaction time after 45 and 90 days of practising meditation.

It leads to several long term complications including cognitive impairment. Yoga is a form of alternative and complementary therapy known to be effective in improving cognitive function. There is however, a lack evidence of the role of yoga on cognitive function in hypertensive patients. Aim: To study the impact of short term residential yoga-based lifestyle intervention on cognitive functions in hypertensive patients. Methodology: Sixty hypertensive subjects, within age range 30 to 60 years (Mean ± SD; 46.92 ± 9.2 yrs) were enrolled in this study. Thirty subjects (IAYT) followed 6 days of residential yoga program, consisting of 5 hrs of different yoga sessions including physical practices, meditation, devotional songs, a low salt & calorie diet and counseling sessions at SVYASA University campus in Bengaluru. Thirty subjects (Non-IAYT) followed their daily routines. Subjects with diabetes, psychiatric problem, stroke, head injury, neurodeficits, history of recent surgery, and previous exposure to yoga in last one year were excluded from the study. All the subjects were administered Digit Letter Substitution Test and Digit Forward and Backward Test at the baseline and after 6 days. Results: For the IAYT group, there was a significant improvement in Digit Forward and Backward Test (p>0.001) scores and in DLST test (p>0.001) after 6 days of intervention compared to baseline. Whereas, non-IAYT group showed, no significant improvement in any of the variables assessed. Therefore, compared to the Non-IAYT group, the IAYT group showed significantly better improve in DF (p < 0.001), DB (p < 0.001) and DLST scores (p < 0.001).

Yoga as an anxiolytic tool which has been practiced over centuries in India. Aims and Objectives: To assess the efficacy of yoga in increasing the cognitive performance in medical students after practicing it for 6 months. Materials and Methods: A comparative study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, MNR Medical College and Hospital, Sangareddy, Medak District, Telangana, India. A total number of 80 medical students who were ready to undergo their first internal examinations were selected. Students were randomly assigned to four groups and were given a 60-min session on pranayama and suryanamaskar. Group I, Control group, was not underwent any kind of yoga during the study period and were given a lecture on stress reduction, practice of meditation without any yoga instructions, Group II, study Group, who can practice only pranayama, Group III who can practice only suryanamaskar and Group IV practices both pranayama and suryanamaskar. The investigator who was unaware of the groups had taken the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-Revised questionnaire of the students two times (a) before appearing for internal examination and (b) after immediately appearing for examination and both were compared after 6 months of yoga for their improvement in cognitive functions. Statistical analysis was performed using analyses of variance (ANOVA) by SPSS V.16. Results: The statistical results showed a significant improvement in the Group A compared to Group B (ANOVA; P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study concludes that yogic breathing and yogic postures (suryanamaskar) has a significant effect on the reduction of anxiety level and improvement in cognitive functions of medical students. © 2016 Ambareesha Goud Kondam et al.","Cognitive function; Medical students; Pranayama; Stress; Suryanamaskar; Yoga","analysis of variance; anxiety; body posture; breathing; comparative study; control group; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; data analysis software; hospital; human; major clinical study; medical school; medical student; meditation; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; stress; Telangana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008403613

Stress and autonomic dysfunction are associated with cardiovascular morbidity. Yoga is the best lifestyle ever designed. Based on limited scientific research, yoga (meditation, asanas, and pranayamas including relaxation) therapy is known to improve cardiovascular autonomic functions. Aims and Objective: To study and compare the effect of 6 months of training in relaxing asanas and pranayamas on blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate (HR), and rate-pressure product (RPP) in young healthy volunteers. Materials and Methods: A total of 109 healthy volunteers aged 20-25 years were divided into 3 groups consisting of asan (n = 38), pranayam (n = 38), and control group (n = 33). The Yoga training was given 25 min/day for 6 days/week for 6 months. Pranayam group received relaxing pranayam (pranav, savitri, nadi shuddhi and chandra nadi), asan group received relaxing asan (pawanmuktasana, balasan, dharnicasan, and shavasan) and waiting list were kept as a control group. The results were statistically compared between groups by analysis of variance and intra-group pre-post comparisons by paired t-test. Results: Post training analysis showed significant decreases in systolic BP and diastolic BP as well as PP, mean arterial pressure and RPP in both asan and pranayam group as compared with control. There was, however, no significant difference between asan and pranayam group. Conclusion: Practising either relaxing asan or pranayam enhances parasympathetic activity and decreases sympathetic activity. © 2016 Vasanthan S et al.","Asan; Blood pressure; Pranayam","adult; analysis of variance; cardiovascular response; cardiovascular system; comparative study; control group; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; heart rate; hospital admission; human; leisure; major clinical study; mean arterial pressure; meditation; parasympathetic tone; pulse pressure; Student t test; sympathetic tone; systolic blood pressure; volunteer; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008324787

These couples commonly experience emotional and physical pain and tension in their marital lives. The purpose of this study is to report on the process of developing a potentially feasible and effective complex intervention for couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment in China. Methods: The Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and evaluating the complex intervention was adopted to guide the development of the Partnership and Coping Enhancement Programme (PCEP). In developing the PCEP, three steps were taken, namely, (1) identifying evidence by conducting literature reviews, a concept analysis and a qualitative study; (2) identifying/developing a theory—in this case, a preliminary Endurance with Partnership Conceptual Framework (P-EPCF) was proposed; and (3) modelling the process and outcomes of the PCEP. Results: The PCEP that was developed is targeted mainly at the domains of the partnership mediators of stress in the P-EPCF. It consists of two sections—partnership and coping—and will be delivered to infertile couples on the day of embryo transfer. The main focuses of the programme are to facilitate mutual sharing and support in infertile couples, and to improve their individual and dyadic coping strategies while undergoing IVF treatment, especially in the period when they are waiting for the results of a pregnancy test and after the disclosure of a negative treatment outcome. The programme is couple-based, consisting of experience sharing, psychoeducation, meditation exercise, skill practise and supplemental written materials. Conclusions: The Partnership and Coping Enhancement Programme (PCEP) for couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment was developed according to the guideline of the MRC framework. It is recommended that a pilot study be conducted to evaluate its feasibility and to model the process and outcomes of the programme. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Coping; Couple-based intervention; In vitro fertilization; Infertility; Marital benefit; Partnership; Psychological well-being","Article; China; concept analysis; conceptual framework; coping behavior; Dyadic Adjustment Scale; female; health program; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; in vitro fertilization; Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale; male; marriage; meditation; patient attitude; priority journal; psychoeducation; psychological well-being; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; reading; scoring system; skill; treatment outcome; embryo transfer; human relation; in vitro fertilization; infertility; mental stress; pathophysiology; pregnancy; psychology; spouse; China; Embryo Transfer; Female; Fertilization in Vitro; Humans; Infertility; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Marriage; Pregnancy; Spouses; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991383879

Methods: We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the BP responses to meditation interventions through a systematic literature search of the PubMed, ABI/INFORM, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases (from January 1980 to October 2015). We meta-Analyzed the change in SBP and DBP, stratified by type of meditation (transcendental meditation vs. nontranscendental meditation intervention) and by type of BP measurement [ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) vs. non-ABPM measurement]. Results: Nineteen studies met the eligibility criteria. Among the studies using the ABPM measurement, the pooled SBP effect estimate was-2.49mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI):-7.51, 2.53] for transcendental meditation intervention (statistically insignificant) and-3.77mmHg (95% CI:-5.33,-2.21) for nontranscendental meditation interventions, whereas the pooled DBP effect estimate was-4.26mmHg (95% CI:-6.21,-2.31) for transcendental meditation interventions and-2.18mmHg (95% CI:-4.28,-0.09) for nontranscendental meditation interventions. Among the studies using the non-ABPM measurement, the pooled SBP effect estimate from transcendental meditation interventions was-5.57mmHg (95% CI:-7.41,-3.73) and was-5.09mmHg with non-Transcendental meditation intervention (95% CI:-6.34,-3.85), whereas the pooled effect size in DBP change for transcendental meditation interventions was-2.86mmHg (95% CI:-4.27,-1.44) and was-2.57mmHg (95% CI:-3.36,-1.79) for nontranscendental meditation interventions. Conclusion: Non-Transcendental meditation may serve as a promising alternative approach for lowering both SBP and DBP. More ABPM-measured transcendental meditation interventions might be needed to examine the benefit of transcendental meditation intervention on SBP reduction.

HHIS Zen practice involves specific neurocardiac-cardiorespiratory interaction while on the way of realizing the heart-dominant, detached brain. Results of analyzing the electrocardiogram and respiratory signals of 10 experienced practitioners reveal several distinctive characteristics: (1) remarkably linear correlation between standard deviation of the normal R-to-R intervals, SDNN, and total power in very-low-frequency (VLF, 0.0033-0.04Hz) band of power spectrum of the heart-rate sequence, (2) time-varying VLF power dominating over the low-frequency and high-frequency power in heart rate variability (HRV) variations, (3) intermittent transition into slowly, deeply abdominal respiration inducing a boost of heart rates, (4) heart-rate baseline slowly fluctuating at 0.005-0.0067Hz, about 1.5-2 cycles in 5-min period, and (5) remarkable respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) synchrony between heart rate and respiration rhythm. This paper proposes a rational scientific hypothesis for the neurocardiac-cardiorespiratory mechanism. The unique scheme of HHIS Zen meditation involves the spiritual-qi concentration and refinement for pinpointing into the particular energy centers, mailuns. Ignition by a subtle, deepest abdominal respiration, electrical impulses rapidly transmit from solar plexus to branchial plexuses to activate unique heart-transition process. Simultaneously, another branch streams upward the spinal cord to cervical plexus and brainstem that effectively harmonizes neurocardiac interactions. To investigate the underlying behaviors, time-domain and frequency-domain HRV based on continuous wavelet transform were employed. © 2016 National Taiwan University.","Heart rate variability; Neurocardiac-cardiorespiratory interactions; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia; Very-low-frequency power; Zen meditation","Diseases; Frequency domain analysis; Wavelet transforms; Cardiorespiratory interaction; Heart rate variability; Respiratory sinus arrhythmia; Very low frequency; Zen meditation; Heart; behavior; brain stem; breathing; celiac plexus; cervical plexus; electrocardiogram; heart rate variability; human; meditation; physician; power spectrum; respiratory sinus arrhythmia; rhythm; spinal cord",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994728013

Detractors claim that this definition of health is utopian and unrealistic. However, accumulating evidence from experimental studies suggests that aging is not inevitably linked with the development of chronic diseases, and the age-associated accumulation of molecular damage can be prevented or greatly delayed by dietary and genetic manipulations that downregulate key cellular nutrient-sensing pathways. Nonetheless, to obtain a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, we as human beings need to go beyond nutrition or pharmacological treatments and implement a combination of interventions that enhance not only our metabolic health but also our psychological, emotional, intellectual and spiritual development, our social relationships and cultural well-being. This perspective highlights a range of scientific research-based interventions that can potentially be used to promote human health and longevity. We will also briefly address the importance of environmental health in achieving this goal. © 2016 S.

For both interventions, participants completed either MET training or Kundalini Yoga (KY) for 60-min sessions over 12 weeks, with 12-min daily homework assignments. Gray matter volume and metabolite concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral hippocampus were measured by structural MRI and 1H-MRS at baseline and after 12 weeks of training. Metabolites measured included glutamate-glutamine (Glx), choline-containing compounds (Cho, including glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and N-acetyl aspartate and N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (NAA-NAAG). In total, 11 participants completed MET and 14 completed yogic meditation for this study. Structural MRI analysis showed an interaction between time and group in dACC, indicating a trend towards increased gray matter volume after the MET intervention. 1H-MRS analysis showed an interaction between time and group in choline-containing compounds in bilateral hippocampus, induced by significant decreases after the MET intervention. Though preliminary, our results suggest that memory training induces structural and neurochemical plasticity in seniors with MCI. Further research is needed to determine whether mind-body interventions like yoga yield similar neuroplastic changes. © 2016 Yang, Leaver, Siddarth, Paholpak, Ercoli, St. Cyr, Eyre, Narr, Khalsa and Lavretsky.","Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; Hippocampus; Memory enhancement training; Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Structural magnetic resonance imaging; Yogic meditation","4 aminobutyric acid; choline; glutamic acid; glutamine; glycerophosphorylcholine; n acetylaspartic acid; n acetylaspartylglutamic acid; phosphorylcholine; adult; alternative medicine; Article; behavior therapy; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; female; gray matter; hippocampus; home care; human; male; memory enhancement training; middle aged; mild cognitive impairment; nerve cell plasticity; neuroanatomy; neurochemistry; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; randomized controlled trial; therapy effect; treatment duration; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006288756

This one hour meditation consists of five stages: Deep fast chaotic breathing, catharsis, using a mantra ""Hoo"", silence, and dancing. A previous study observed that Osho dynamic meditation causes decrease in several psychopathological variables such as aggressive behaviour, anxiety and depression. However, it is not objectively established that the dynamic meditation has an anti-stress effect. Aim: To find out the effect of Osho dynamic meditation on the serum cortisol levels (cortisol is an indicator of stress) and therefore to observe whether it has any anti-stress effect. Materials and Methods: An experimental study was planned doing the dynamic meditation empty stomach in morning at 6 to 7 am every day for 21 days from 1st March 2015 to 21st March 2015 at Lucknow. Twenty healthy volunteers between 20 to 50 years (14 males and 6 females) participated in the study. Serum cortisol level was estimated from the blood samples collected in the morning one day prior (baseline) and post-meditation onthe 21st day of the study. The difference between mean cortisol levels of the baseline and post-meditation groups were tested for significance by applying the paired t-test. Results: Sixteen volunteers out of the 20 completed the study while four dropped out due to their health and personal reasons. The serum cortisol levels were decreased in all the 16 participants on 21st day as compared to the baseline levels and the decline in the mean cortisol level was highly significant (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The results of the study showed a significant reduction in plasma cortisol levels when the participants were tested after 21 days of meditation; it can be concluded that the Osho dynamic meditation produces anti-stress effects. The mechanism of action could primarily be attributed to the release of repressed emotions and psychological inhibitions and traumas. Thus, dynamic meditation could be recommended for the amelioration of stress and stress related physical and mental disorders. More clinical studies should be done on dynamic meditation to prove its efficacy and become an approved therapy in hospitals. © 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

Oxytocin, a neuropeptide implicated in social cognition and behavior, is one biological mechanism that may influence an individual's capacity to extract positive emotions from social contexts. Because variation in certain genes may indicate underlying neurobiological differences, we tested whether several SNPs in two genes related to oxytocin signaling would show effects on positive emotions that were context-specific, depending on sociality. For six weeks, a sample of mid-life adults (N = 122) participated in either socially-focused loving-kindness training or mindfulness training. During this timespan they reported their positive emotions daily. Five SNPs within OXTR and CD38 were assayed, and each was tested for its individual effect on daily emotions. The hypothesized three-way interaction between time, training type, and genetic variability emerged: Individuals homozygous for the G allele of OXTR rs1042778 experienced gains in daily positive emotions from loving-kindness training, whereas individuals with the T allele did not experience gains in positive emotions with either training. These findings are among the first to show how genetic differences in oxytocin signaling may influence an individual's capacity to experience positive emotions as a result of a socially-focused intervention. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Affective science; Genetics; Meditation; Oxytocin; Positive psychology; Vantage sensitivity","CD38 antigen; oxytocin; OXTR protein, human; oxytocin receptor; adult; allele; Article; CD38 gene; controlled study; emotion; female; gene; genetic variation; hope; human; longitudinal study; love; male; mindfulness; normal human; OXTR gene; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; social behavior; social cognition; social environment; social interaction; training; emotion; genetics; human relation; meditation; middle aged; physiology; procedures; Adult; Emotions; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Oxytocin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982195938

It is important for clinicians to identify women at risk for noninitiation. Objective: To determine whether complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is associated with decreased breast cancer chemotherapy initiation. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multisite prospective cohort study (the Breast Cancer Quality of Care [BQUAL] study) designed to examine predictors of breast cancer treatment initiation and adherence, 685 women younger than 70 years with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer were recruited from Columbia University Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, and Henry Ford Health System and enrolled between May 2006 and July 31, 2010. Overall, 306 patients (45%) were clinically indicated to receive chemotherapy per National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Participants were followed for up to 12 months. Exposures Baseline interviews assessed current use of 5 CAM modalities (vitamins and/or minerals, herbs and/or botanicals, other natural products, mind-body self-practice, mind-body practitioner-based practice). CAM use definitions included any use, dietary supplement use, mind-body use, and a CAM index summing the 5 modalities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Chemotherapy initiationwas assessed via self-report up to 12 months after baseline. Multivariable logistic regression models examined a priori hypotheses testing whether CAM use was associated with chemotherapy initiation, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, and delineating groups by age and chemotherapy indication. Results: A cohort of 685 women younger than 70 years (mean age, 59 years; median age, 59 years) with nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer were recruited and followed for up to 12 months to examine predictors of breast cancer treatment initiation. Baseline CAM use was reported by 598 women (87%). Chemotherapy was initiated by 272 women (89%) for whom chemotherapy was indicated, compared with 135 women (36%) for whom chemotherapy was discretionary. Among women for whom chemotherapy was indicated, dietary supplement users and women with high CAM index scores were less likely than nonusers to initiate chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95%CI, 0.03-0.51; and OR per unit, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46-0.87, respectively). Use of mind-body practices was not related to chemotherapy initiation (OR, 1.45; 95%CI, 0.57-3.59). There was no association between CAM use and chemotherapy initiation among women for whom chemotherapy was discretionary. Conclusions and Relevance: CAM use was high among patients with early-stage breast cancer enrolled in a multisite prospective cohort study. Current dietary supplement use and higher number of CAM modalities used but not mind-body practices were associated with decreased initiation of clinically indicated chemotherapy. Oncologists should consider discussing CAM with their patients during the chemotherapy decision-making process. © 2016 American Medical Association.

It also influences resting-state functional connectivity between affective networks and the posterior cingulate (PCC)/precuneus, regions critically implicated in self-referential processing. However, no longitudinal study employing active control group has examined the effect of meditation training on affective processing, PCC/precuneus connectivity, and their association. Here, we report that eight-week meditation, but not relaxation, training ‘neutralized’ affective processing of positive and negative stimuli in healthy elderly participants. Additionally, meditation versus relaxation training increased the positive connectivity between the PCC/precuneus and the pons, the direction of which was largely directed from the pons to the PCC/precuneus, as revealed by dynamic causal modeling. Further, changes in connectivity between the PCC/precuneus and pons predicted changes in affective processing after meditation training. These findings indicate meditation promotes self-referential affective regulation based on increased regulatory influence of the pons on PCC/precuneus, which new affective-processing strategy is employed across both resting state and when evaluating affective stimuli. Such insights have clinical implications on interventions on elderly individuals with affective disorders. © 2016 The Authors","Affective processing; Functional connectivity; Meditation; Pons; Resting-state MRI","adult; aged; Article; brain function; connectome; controlled study; emotion; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; male; mathematical model; meditation; middle aged; mood disorder; nerve projection; normal human; pons; posterior cingulate; precuneus; priority journal; relaxation training; brain; brain mapping; cingulate gyrus; leisure; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; pons; Aged; Brain; Brain Mapping; Emotions; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Pons; Relaxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027947612

A major training method of Chan Ding is to focus on the ten Mailuns, i.e., energy points, and to maintain physical stillness. In this article, wireless wearable accelerometers were used to detect physical stillness, and the created physical stillness index (PSI) was also shown. Ninety college students participated in this study. Primarily, accelerometers used on the arms and chest were examined. The results showed that the PSI values on the arms were higher than that of the chest, when participants moved their bodies in three different ways, left-right, anterior-posterior, and hand, movements with natural breathing. Then, they were divided into three groups to practice Chan Ding for approximately thirty minutes. Participants without any Chan Ding experience were in Group I. Participants with one year of Chan Ding experience were in Group II, and participants with over three year of experience were in Group III. The Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI) was also conducted. Results showed that the PSI of the three groups measured during 20-30 min were 0.123 ± 0.155, 0.012 ± 0.013, and 0.001 ± 0.0003, respectively (p < 0.001 ***). The averaged CHI scores of the three groups were 10.13, 17.17, and 25.53, respectively (p < 0.001 ***). Correlation coefficients between PSI and CHI of the three groups were -0.440, -0.369, and -0.537, respectively (p < 0.01 **). PSI value and the wearable accelerometer that are presently available on the market could be used to evaluate the quality of the physical stillness of the participants during Chan Ding practice. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Chan ding; Chinese happiness inventory; Meditation; Physical stillness index (PSI); Wearable accelerometer","Accelerometers; Quality control; Students; Wearable technology; Anterior posteriors; Chan ding; Chinese happiness inventory; Correlation coefficient; Emotional wellbeing; Meditation; Natural breathing; Physical stillness index (PSI); Wearable sensors; accelerometry; ambulatory monitoring; arm; genetic procedures; human; mental health; procedures; thorax; Accelerometry; Arm; Biosensing Techniques; Humans; Mental Health; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Thorax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979034857

The meditation practice changes the attentional allocation in the human brain to visualize this; statistical features are carefully calculated from different wavelet coefficients to categorize two diverse groups (i.e. Meditators and Non-Meditators). The entire time series of EEG data divided into overlapping segments, and statistical parameters calculated for each of these segments. Instead of using all the data points, we used only a few higher order statistical measures such as variance, kurtosis, relative band energy, Shannon entropy, and Renyi entropy obtained from the data segments. A standard clustering technique, i.e. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used to get the distinct pattern from the statistical features in EEG. In this paper, we presented a clustering paradigm that used for the pattern analysis between meditators and non-meditators. We measured the EEG signal using 64 channels, with some peripheral physiological measures. 23 participants with varying experience in meditation practice and ten non-meditators (control group) are considered to visualize underlying clusters within the statistical features. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Biomedical engineering; Multivariant analysis; Statistical methods; Statistics; Clustering techniques; Different wavelets; Multivariate pattern analysis; Normal condition; Physiological measures; Statistical features; Statistical measures; Statistical parameters; Principal component analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982102976

(2014) demonstrated that brief self-compassion meditation training (SCT) dampened sympathetic (salivary alpha-amylase) and subjective anxiety responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), relative to attention and no-instruction control conditions. The present study examined baseline predictors and moderators of these SCT intervention effects. Baseline characteristics included two stress vulnerability traits (social anxiety and rumination) and two potential resiliency traits (non-attachment and self-compassion). We investigated how these traits moderated the effects of SCT on response to the TSST, relative to the control conditions. We also tested how these individual differences predicted TSST responses across conditions in order to uncover characteristics that confer increased vulnerability and resiliency to social stressors. Trait non-attachment, rumination (for sympathetic TSST response only), and social anxiety (for subjective TSST response only) interacted with training condition to moderate TSST responses such that following SCT, lower attachment and lower social anxiety predicted lower TSST stress responses, relative to those scoring higher on these traits. In contrast, trait self-compassion neither moderated nor predicted responses to the TSST. Thus, although SCT had robust effects on buffering stress across individuals with varying levels of trait self-compassion, other psychological traits enhanced or dampened the effect of SCT on TSST responses. These findings support the importance of examining the role of relevant baseline psychological traits to predict sympathetic and subjective responses to social evaluative threat, particularly in the context of resiliency training. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Alpha-amylase; Meditation; Self-compassion; Social anxiety; Social evaluative threat; Stress","anxiety; Article; controlled study; coping behavior; female; human; human experiment; meditation; normal human; priority journal; psychologic test; rumination; self care; self compassion meditation training; social phobia; social psychology; social stress; Trier Social Stress Test; adult; empathy; forecasting; genetics; meditation; mental stress; metabolism; physiology; prevention and control; psychology; saliva; alpha amylase saliva isoenzyme; hydrocortisone; Adult; Anxiety; Empathy; Female; Forecasting; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Meditation; Phobia, Social; Saliva; Salivary alpha-Amylases; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962568732

However, there is currently no effective pharmacological treatment approved for MCI. There is a paucity of evidence that non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive training could result in improvements in the daily activities functioning of persons with MCI. Growing evidence has shown that mindfulness meditation increases gray matter volume and concentration in brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, strengthens brain functional connectivity, and enhances psychological well-being which could be beneficial to counteract the memory and cognitive decline of MCI. Aims: We aim to quantitatively investigate whether mindfulness practice can improve the cognitive function, psychological health, mindfulness and functional abilities in activities of daily living of the MCI participants over time; the relationship between the amount of mindfulness practice and degree of improvement in these health outcomes; and the differential effects and interactions of both formal and informal mindfulness practices. We will also qualitatively address the issues about the MCI participants' and familiar support persons' engagement with the program, the nature of group interactions, their program experience, their perceived effects and expectations of mindfulness practice, and the challenges encountered in practicing mindfulness. Methods: Our study is one of the first mixed-methods longitudinal studies with a 1-year follow-up using a pre- and post-intervention design. It involves the MCI participants and their familiar support person in a customized 8-week group-based mindfulness training program. The outcome measures will use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory and Bayer Activities of Daily Living Scale. The qualitative methods will include participant observation during the program and semi-structured interviews at post-intervention and 1-year follow-up. Significance: This customized MCI group mindfulness training program presents as a promising and feasible non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention option for MCI and a possible preventive strategy for Alzheimer's disease.

This comparative review explores a neglected area relevant to current research: the validity of a traditional central nervous system (CNS) model that coevolved with the practices most studied today and that provides the first comprehensive neural-based typology and mechanistic framework of contemplative practices. The subtle body model, popularly known as the chakra system from Indian yoga, was and is used as a map of CNS function in traditional Indian and Tibetan medicine, neuropsychiatry, and neuropsychology. The study presented here, based on the Nalanda tradition, shows that the subtle body model can be cross-referenced with modern CNS maps and challenges modern brain maps with its embodied network model of CNS function. It also challenges meditation research by: (1) presenting a more rigorous, neural-based typology of contemplative practices; (2) offering a more refined and complete network model of the mechanisms of contemplative practices; and (3) serving as an embodied, interoceptive neurofeedback aid that is more user friendly and complete than current teaching aids for clinical and practical applications of contemplative practice. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.","contemplative neuroscience; meditation; mindfulness; neurofeedback; subtle body; yoga","brain; central nervous system function; meditation; mindfulness; model; neurofeedback; neuropsychiatry; neuropsychology; teaching; Tibetan medicine; validity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027929378

Because the brain is the master regulator of these systems, as well as of behavior, alterations in brain function by chronic stress can have direct and indirect effects on cumulative allostatic overload, which refers to the cost of adaptation. There is much new knowledge on the neural control of systemic physiology and the feedback actions of physiologic mediators on brain regions regulating higher cognitive function, emotional regulation, and self-regulation. The healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience, based upon its ability to respond to interventions designed to open “windows of plasticity” and redirect its function toward better health. As a result, plasticity-facilitating treatments should be given within the framework of a positive behavioral intervention; negative experiences during this window may even make matters worse. Indeed, there are no magic bullets and drugs cannot substitute for targeted interventions that help an individual become resilient, of which mindfulness-based stress reduction and meditation are emerging as useful tools. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.","allostasis; allostatic load/overload; amygdala; eudaimonia; hippocampus; meditation; mindfulness; physical activity; prefrontal cortex; self-regulation","fluoxetine; hydrocortisone; allostasis; ambiguity; Article; autoregulation; brain region; caloric restriction; chronic stress; circadian rhythm; cognition; epigenetics; feedback system; human; mindfulness; nerve cell plasticity; physical activity; prefrontal cortex; regulatory mechanism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979643828

Our adaptation, mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), has resulted in improvements across a range of psychological and biological outcomes, including cortisol slopes, blood pressure, and telomere length, in various groups of cancer survivors. In this paper, I review the rationale for MBIs in cancer care and provide an overview of the state of the current literature, with a focus on results from three recent clinical trials conducted by our research group. These include a comparative efficacy trial comparing MBCR to supportive–expressive therapy in distressed breast cancer survivors, a non-inferiority trial comparing MBCR to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in cancer survivors with clinical insomnia, and an online adaptation of MBCR for rural and remote cancer survivors without access to in-person groups. I conclude by outlining work in progress and future directions for MBI research and applications in cancer care. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.","anxiety; cancer; depression; meditation; mindfulness; stress","Article; breast cancer; cancer center; cancer survivor; cognitive behavioral therapy; coping behavior; human; insomnia; mindfulness; mindfulness based cancer recovery; psychotherapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979581682

To address this crucial problem, novel interventions are needed to restore hedonic regulatory processes gone awry in persons exhibiting addictive behaviors. This article describes a theoretical rationale and empirical evidence for the effects of one such new intervention, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), on top-down and bottom-up mechanisms implicated in cognitive control and hedonic regulation. MORE is innovative and distinct from extant mindfulness-based interventions in that it unites traditional mindfulness meditation with reappraisal and savoring strategies designed to reverse the downward shift in salience of natural reward relative to drug reward, representing a crucial tipping point to disrupt the progression of addiction—a mechanistic target that no other behavioral intervention has been designed to address. Though additional studies are needed, clinical and biobehavioral data from several completed and ongoing trials suggest that MORE may exert salutary effects on addictive behaviors and the neurobiological processes that underpin them. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.","addiction; allostasis; mindfulness; reappraisal; reward; savoring","addiction; Article; autoregulation; executive function; human; information processing; metacognitive awareness; mindfulness; Mindfulness Oriented Recovery Enhancement; physiological stress; psychotherapy; reinforcement; reward; working memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979523596

This systematic review of research on school-based yoga interventions published in peer-reviewed journals offers a bibliometric analysis that identified 47 publications. The studies from these publications have been conducted primarily in the United States (n = 30) and India (n = 15) since 2005, with the majority of studies (n = 41) conducted from 2010 onward. About half of the publications were of studies at elementary schools; most (85%) were conducted within the school curriculum, and most (62%) also implemented a formal school-based yoga program. There was a high degree of variability in yoga intervention characteristics, including overall duration, and the number and duration of sessions. Most of these published research trials are preliminary in nature, with numerous study design limitations, including limited sample sizes (median = 74; range = 20–660) and relatively weak research designs (57% randomized controlled trials, 19% uncontrolled trials), as would be expected in an infant research field.

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in how mindfulness meditation improves human health and well-being. Although studies have shown that mindfulness meditation can improve self-reported measures of disease symptomatology, the effect that mindfulness meditation has on biological mechanisms underlying human aging and disease is less clear. To address this issue, we conducted the first comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of mindfulness meditation on immune system parameters, with a specific focus on five outcomes: (1) circulating and stimulated inflammatory proteins, (2) cellular transcription factors and gene expression, (3) immune cell count, (4) immune cell aging, and (5) antibody response. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity across studies with respect to patient population, study design, and assay procedures. The findings suggest possible effects of mindfulness meditation on specific markers of inflammation, cell-mediated immunity, and biological aging, but these results are tentative and require further replication. On the basis of this analysis, we describe the limitations of existing work and suggest possible avenues for future research. Mindfulness meditation may be salutogenic for immune system dynamics, but additional work is needed to examine these effects. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.","aging; biology; cytokines; disease; health; immune system; inflammation; intervention; meditation; mindfulness","C reactive protein; transcription factor; aging; antibody response; Article; awareness; cellular immunity; comparative study; gene expression; immune system; immunocompetent cell; meditation; mindfulness; randomized controlled trial (topic); sampling; systematic review",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979519053

Spontaneous mind wandering is typically associated with self-reflective states that contribute to negative processing of the past, worrying/fantasizing about the future, and disruption of primary task performance. On the other hand, mindful awareness is frequently described as a focus on present sensory input without cognitive elaboration or emotional reactivity, and is associated with improved task performance and decreased stress-related symptomology. Unfortunately, such distinctions fail to acknowledge similarities and interactions between the two states. Instead of an inverse relationship between mindfulness and mind wandering, a more nuanced characterization of mindfulness may involve skillful toggling back and forth between conceptual and nonconceptual processes and networks supporting each state, to meet the contextually specified demands of the situation. In this article, we present a theoretical analysis and plausible neurocognitive framework of the restful mind, in which we attempt to clarify potentially adaptive contributions of both mind wandering and mindful awareness through the lens of the extant neurocognitive literature on intrinsic network activity, meditation, and emerging descriptions of stillness and nonduality. A neurophenomenological approach to probing modality-specific forms of concentration and nonconceptual awareness is presented that may improve our understanding of the resting state.

The scientific study of meditation as a potential tool to downregulate processes implicated in brain aging is an emerging field, and a growing body of research suggests that mindfulness practices are beneficial for cerebral resilience. Adding further evidence to this notion, an increasing number of imaging studies report effects of meditation on brain structure that are consistent with our understanding of neuroprotection. Here, we review the published findings in this field of research addressing the question of whether meditation diminishes age-related brain degeneration. Altogether, although analyses are still sparse and based on cross-sectional data, study outcomes suggest that meditation might be beneficial for brain preservation—both with respect to gray and white matter—possibly by slowing down the natural (age-related) decrease of brain tissue. Nevertheless, it should also be recognized that, until robust longitudinal data become available, there is no evidence for causation between meditation and brain preservation.

Despite several adverse effects, ritodrine hydrochloride is frequently prescribed to suppress preterm labor in Japan, and its usage may therefore indicate cases of preterm labor. This study aimed to clarify the association between prenatal yoga and ritodrine hydrochloride use during pregnancy. Methods: An observational study was conducted as an adjunct study by the Hokkaido unit of the Japan Environment and Children's Study. Information on prenatal yoga practice was collected using a self-questionnaire between March 21, 2012, and July 7, 2015, targeting women who had recently delivered. Ritodrine hydrochloride use was identified from medical records. A total of 2,692 women were analyzed using logistic regression models that adjusted for possible confounders. Results: There were 567 (21.1%) women who practiced prenatal yoga, which was associated with a lower risk of ritodrine hydrochloride use (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.98). This was especially evident in women with a total practice duration that exceeded 900 minutes throughout their pregnancy (adjusted OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.38-0.76). A sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with threatened abortion during the study period produced similar results. Conclusions: Prenatal yoga was associated with a lower risk of ritodrine hydrochloride use, particularly in women with more than 900 minutes of practice time over the course of their pregnancy. Prenatal yoga may be a beneficial option for pregnant women in the selection of alternative therapies. © 2016 Kawanishi et al.

With the rise in rates of inflammation-related medical conditions, evidence for behavioral approaches that reduce stress reactivity is of value. Here, we compare 31 experienced meditators, with an average of approximately 9000 lifetime hours of meditation practice (M age = 51 years) to an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 37; M age = 48 years) on measures of stress- and inflammatory responsivity, and measures of psychological health. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was used to induce psychological stress and a neurogenic inflammatory response was produced using topical application of capsaicin cream to forearm skin. Size of the capsaicin-induced flare response and increase in salivary cortisol and alpha amylase were used to quantify the magnitude of inflammatory and stress responses, respectively. Results show that experienced meditators have lower TSST-evoked cortisol (62.62 ± 2.52 vs. 70.38 ± 2.33; p < .05) and perceived stress (4.18 ± .41 vs. 5.56 ± .30; p < .01), as well as a smaller neurogenic inflammatory response (81.55 ± 4.6 vs. 96.76 ± 4.26; p < .05), compared to the control group. Moreover, experienced meditators reported higher levels of psychological factors associated with wellbeing and resilience. These results suggest that the long-term practice of meditation may reduce stress reactivity and could be of therapeutic benefit in chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by neurogenic inflammation. © 2016 .","Alpha amylase; Cortisol; HPA-axis; Inflammation; Stress","amylase; capsaicin; hydrocortisone; amylase; hydrocortisone; adrenergic system; adult; age; Article; controlled study; coping behavior; female; human; human experiment; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; male; meditation; mental stress; middle aged; mindfulness; nervous system inflammation; normal human; priority journal; psychological well being; saliva level; self report; sex; inflammation; meditation; mental stress; metabolism; methodology; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); saliva; Adult; alpha-Amylases; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Inflammation; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Saliva; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961779049

There is certain evidence that physical exercise positively affects excessive alcohol use and the associated problems by leading to reduced alcohol intake. A literature search was conducted using the databases PubMed, Medline and Web of Science. The search terms used as keywords were: Addiction, abuse, alcohol use disorders, exercise training, β-endorphin, opioids, brain, ethanol and alcohol. The current study presents the studies that reported on the use of exercise in the treatment of AUDs between 1970 and 2015. The potential psychological and physiological mechanisms that contribute to the action of exercise were also reviewed, highlighting the role of β-endorphin and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in AUDs and the possible association among physical activity, the endogenous opioid system and the desire for alcohol. Only 11 studies were identified that refer to the effect of exercise on alcohol consumption and/or the associated outcomes. Six of those studies concluded that exercise may have a positive impact towards alcohol consumption, abstinence rates or the urge to drink. One of those studies also indicated that a bout of exercise affects the endogenous opioids, which may be associated with the urge to drink. Another 3 studies indicated that responses to acute exercise in individuals with AUDs are different compared to those in healthy ones. Generally, despite limited research data and often contradictory results, there is certain early promising evidence for the role of exercise as an adjunctive tool in the treatment of AUDs. Physiological and biochemical parameters that would confirm that exercise is safe for individuals with AUDs should be examined in future studies. © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

In this paper, we review the existing literature on the cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness through the lens of network science. We describe the characteristics of the intrinsic brain networks implicated in mindfulness and summarize the relevant findings pertaining to changes in functional connectivity (FC) within and between these networks. Convergence across these findings suggests that mindfulness may be associated with increased FC between two regions within the default network: the posterior cingulate cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, extensive meditation experience may be associated with increased FC between the insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, little consensus has emerged within the existing literature owing to the diversity of operational definitions of mindfulness, neuroimaging methods, and network characterizations. We describe several challenges to develop a coherent cognitive neuroscience of mindfulness and to provide detailed recommendations for future research. © 2016 The New York Academy of Sciences.","Brain networks; Functional connectivity; Meditation; Mindfulness","brain; cognitive neuroscience; consensus; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; insula; meditation; mindfulness; neuroimaging; noise; posterior cingulate; ventromedial prefrontal cortex; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; human; nerve cell network; physiology; procedures; Brain; Brain Mapping; Humans; Meditation; Mindfulness; Nerve Net",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981762892

Although societies are of different faiths and belief systems, what they all share is spirituality. Objectives: Upon this we put forward the hypothesis of changes in gene receptor expressions as a result of spiritual intervention for the first time in the world. Materials and Methods: In this study, the spiritual intervention was conducted on 57 volunteer females with early breast cancer involvement. Blood samples were collected prior to and after the spiritual intervention to analyze the changes in dopamine gene receptor expressions as the main site of effect. In order to administer the spiritual intervention backed by Quran, Islam and international standards, issues, with emphasis on peace, human growth and perfection, accepting God as an eternal source of power and kindness to build trust and reduce stress, were selected. They included prayer, patience, reliance, self-sacrifice and forgiveness, altruism and kindness, remission and repentance, thankfulness, zikr (mantra), meditation, and death concept. Results: Obtained results from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples analyzed by real time-PCR showed significant reduction in dopamine gene receptor (DRD1-5) expressions in comparison with those of pre-test scores and the control group. Conclusions: Spiritual intervention based on Islamic principals can bring back mental health, increase hope and quality of life and eventually change dopamine gene receptor expressions resulting in reduction of cell proliferation, thus better prevention and management in breast cancer patients compared to other forms of treatment. © 2016, Iranian Journal of Cancer Prevention.","Breast cancer; Gene expression; Islamic perspective; Spiritual intervention","dopamine 1 receptor; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 3 receptor; dopamine 4 receptor; dopamine 5 receptor; dopamine receptor; altruism; antiproliferative activity; Article; blood sampling; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer prevention; clinical article; controlled study; death; dopamine receptor gene; female; forgiveness; gene expression; hope; human; human cell; Islam; meditation; mental health; patience; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; quality of life; real time polymerase chain reaction; religion; remission; spiritual healing; stress; therapy effect; trust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977562457

One of the connecting links between pregnancy complications and maternal stress is mind-body intervention which can be part of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Biologic measures of stress during pregnancy may get reduced by such interventions. Aim: To evaluate the effect of Mindfulness meditation on perceived stress scores and autonomic function tests of pregnant Indian women. Materials and Methods: Pregnant Indian women of 12 weeks gestation were randomised to two treatment groups: Test group with Mindfulness meditation and control group with their usual obstetric care. The effect of Mindfulness meditation on perceived stress scores and cardiac sympathetic functions and parasympathetic functions (Heart rate variation with respiration, lying to standing ratio, standing to lying ratio and respiratory rate) were evaluated on pregnant Indian women. Results: There was a significant decrease in perceived stress scores, a significant decrease of blood pressure response to cold pressor test and a significant increase in heart rate variability in the test group (p< 0.05, significant) which indicates that mindfulness meditation is a powerful modulator of the sympathetic nervous system and can thereby reduce the day-to-day perceived stress in pregnant women. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that mindfulness meditation improves parasympathetic functions in pregnant women and is a powerful modulator of the sympathetic nervous system during pregnancy. © 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

We analyzed CAM use among women with a family history of breast cancer. CAM use was analyzed among women enrolled 2003–2009 in the Sister Study cohort. Eligible women were aged 35–74, U.S. or Puerto Rican residents, no personal history of breast cancer, and had ≥1 sister with breast cancer. Baseline data on CAM use in the past year were available for 49,734 women. Logistic regression models examined the association between CAM use and Gail Model breast cancer risk score. Results were compared to female participants in the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (n = 7965). Among Sister Study participants, there was high use of vitamin/mineral supplements (79 %), mind-body practices (41 %), manipulative/body-based practices (32 %), and botanicals (23 %). Overall use was higher than the U.S. female population. No association was observed between familial breast cancer risk and CAM use. Black women were more likely to use spirituality/meditation-based CAM modalities, while non-Hispanic white and Asian women were high users of dietary supplements. In a cohort of women with increased breast cancer risk due to family history, CAM use is higher than women in the general U.S. population and is associated with race/ethnicity. Use was not associated with breast cancer risk. Given the high prevalence of CAM use among women at risk for breast caner, research on the effectiveness of CAM use for disease prevention is needed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Breast cancer; Breast cancer risk; Complementary and alternative medicine; Gail model","ascorbic acid; calcium; estrogen; multivitamin; progesterone; pyridoxine; ubidecarenone; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; alternative medicine; Article; body mass; breast cancer; caloric intake; cancer risk; chemoprophylaxis; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; diet supplementation; Echinacea; educational status; employment status; ethnic difference; family history; female; Gail model; health behavior; homeopathy; hormone substitution; human; income; lifestyle; linseed; manipulative medicine; marriage; meditation; middle aged; mineral supplementation; model; physical activity; predictor variable; priority journal; Puerto Rico; race difference; religion; smoking; tea; United States; vitamin supplementation; African American; alternative medicine; Breast Neoplasms; Caucasian; ethnology; Hispanic; procedures; prospective study; sibling; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Logistic Models; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Siblings; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961644853

As a mixed nerve, the VN contributes to the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut, i.e., the brain-gut axis. In particular, after integration in the central autonomic network of peripheral sensations such as inflammation and pain via vagal and spinal afferents, an efferent response through modulation of preganglionic parasympathetic neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and/or preganglionic sympathetic neurons of the spinal cord is able to modulate gastrointestinal nociception, motility, and inflammation. A low vagal tone, as assessed by heart rate variability, a marker of the sympatho-vagal balance, is observed in functional digestive disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases. To restore a normal vagal tone appears as a goal in such diseases. Among the therapeutic tools, such as drugs targeting the cholinergic system and/or complementary medicine (hypnosis, meditation...), deep breathing, physical exercise, VN stimulation (VNS), either invasive or non-invasive, appears as innovative.

But these prediction techniques are still seldom used in clinical practice, partly due to its limited diagnostic accuracy and to the lack of consensus about the appropriate computational signal processing implementation. This paper addresses a three-fold approach, based on ECG indices, to structure this review on sudden cardiac risk stratification. First, throughout the computational techniques that had been widely proposed for obtaining these indices in technical literature. Second, over the scientific evidence, that although is supported by observational clinical studies, they are not always representative enough. And third, via the limited technology transfer of academy-accepted algorithms, requiring further meditation for future systems. We focus on three families of ECG derived indices which are tackled from the aforementioned viewpoints, namely, heart rate turbulence (HRT), heart rate variability (HRV), and T-wave alternans. In terms of computational algorithms, we still need clearer scientific evidence, standardizing, and benchmarking, siting on advanced algorithms applied over large and representative datasets. New scenarios like electronic health recordings, big data, long-term monitoring, and cloud databases, will eventually open new frameworks to foresee suitable new paradigms in the near future. © 2016 Gimeno-Blanes, Blanco-Velasco, Barquero-Pérez, García-Alberola and Rojo-álvarez.","Computational algorithms; Heart rate turbulence; Heart rate variability; Risk stratification; Scientific evidence; Sudden cardiac death; T-wave alternans; Technology transfer","acute heart infarction; bicycle ergometry; Brugada syndrome; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; coronary artery disease; electrocardiography; electrophysiology; exercise test; heart failure; heart left bundle branch block; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart rate turbulence; heart rate variability; heart ventricle arrhythmia; heart ventricle extrasystole; heart ventricle tachycardia; Holter monitoring; human; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; information processing; ischemic cardiomyopathy; nonischemic cardiomyopathy; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; P wave; practice guideline; pressoreceptor reflex; QRS complex; QRS interval; Review; risk factor; sudden cardiac death; support vector machine; T wave; T wave alterans; technology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964584584

Design Twenty three experienced practitioners of Sahaja Yoga Meditation and twenty three nonmeditators matched on age, gender and education level, were scanned using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging and their grey matter volume were compared using Voxel- Based Morphometry. Results Grey matter volume was larger in meditators relative to non-meditators across the whole brain. In addition, grey matter volume was larger in several predominantly right hemispheric regions: in insula, ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex, inferior temporal and parietal cortices as well as in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left insula. No areas with larger grey matter volume were found in non-meditators relative to meditators. Conclusions The study shows that long-Term practice of Sahaja Yoga Meditation is associated with larger grey matter volume overall, and with regional enlargement in several right hemispheric cortical and subcortical brain regions that are associated with sustained attention, self-control, compassion and interoceptive perception. The increased grey matter volume in these attention and self-control mediating regions suggests use-dependent enlargement with regular practice of this meditation. © 2016 Hernández et al.

We administered standard surveys to measure wisdom and experience among four groups of practitioners of mental and somatic practices, namely, meditators, practitioners of the Alexander Technique, practitioners of the Feldenkrais Method, and classical ballet dancers. We additionally administered surveys of trait anxiety and empathy to all participants to explore possible mediating relationships of experience and wisdom by characteristics thought to be components of wisdom. Wisdom was higher on average among meditation practitioners, and lowest among ballet dancers, and this difference held when controlling for differences in age between practices, supporting the view that meditation is linked to wisdom and that ballet is not. However, we found that increased experience with meditation and ballet were both positively associated with wisdom, and that lowered trait anxiety mediated this positive association among meditation practitioners, and, non-significantly, among ballet dancers. These results suggest that not all practices that are purported to affect mental processing are related to wisdom to the same degree and different kinds of experience appear to relate to wisdom in different ways, suggesting different mechanisms that might underlie the development of wisdom with experience. © 2016 Williams et al.

While yoga has been shown to increase balance, it has also been associated with injuries due to falls during practice. This study aimed to analyse whether regular yoga or meditation practice is associated with the frequency of falls and fall-related injuries in upper middle-aged Australian women. Methods Women aged 59-64 years from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) were queried regarding falls and falls-related injuries; and whether they regularly practiced yoga or meditation. Associations of falls and falls-related injuries with yoga or meditation practice were analysed using chi-squared tests and multiple logistic regression modelling. Results Of 10,011 women, 4413 (44.1%) had slipped, tripped or stumbled, 2770 (27.7%) had fallen to the ground, 1398 (14.0%) had been injured as a result of falling, and 901 (9.0%) women had sought medical attention for a fall-related injury within the previous 12 months. Yoga or meditation was practiced regularly by 746 (7.5%) women. No associations of falls, fall-related injuries and treatment due to falls-related injury with yoga or meditation practice were found. Discussion No association between yoga or meditation practice and falls or fall-related injuries have been found. Further studies are warranted for conclusive judgement of benefits and safety of yoga and meditation in relation to balance, falls and fall-related injuries. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Method: A systematic review was carried out to identify prospective or retrospective studies and interventions published up to June 2015 that reported associations between telomerase activity and psychological stress, mental disorders and lifestyle factors. Electronic data bases of PubMed, ProQuest, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched. Results: Twenty six studies on humans measured telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or leukocytes and examined its association with psychological stress, mental disorders and lifestyle factors. Of those studies, three reported significantly decreased telomerase activity in individuals under chronic psychological stress. Interestingly, one of the three studies found that acute laboratory psychological stress significantly increased telomerase activity. Nine studies reported mixed results on association between mental disorders and telomerase activity. Of the nine studies, five reported that major depressive disorder (MDD) was associated with significantly increased telomerase activity. In thirteen out of fourteen studies on lifestyle factors, it was reported that physical exercise, diet micronutrient supplementation, mindfulness meditation, Qigong practice or yoga mediation resulted in increase in telomerase activity. In addition, two studies on animal models showed that depression-like behaviour was associated with decreased hippocampus telomerase activity. Five animal studies showed that physical exercise increased telomerase activity by cell-type-specific and genotype-specific manners. Conclusion: Although multi-facet results were reported on the association between telomerase activity and psychological stress, mental disorders and lifestyle factors, there were some consistent findings in humans such as (1) decreased telomerase activity in individuals under chronic stress, (2) increased telomerase activity in individuals with MDD, and (3) increased telomerase activity in individuals under lifestyle interventions. Animal studies showed that physical exercise increased telomerase activity in specific cell-types. However, the exact mechanisms for the changes in telomerase activity have not been elucidated. We propose conglomerate models connecting chronic psychological stress, depression, mediation and physical exercise to telomerase activation.

It has been shown previously that intensive or prolonged mind and body therapies (MBT) may have beneficial effects on the well-being of healthy people and in patients. Telomerase activity and levels of peripheral blood adult pluripotent stem cells (PB-APSC) are reliable markers of longterm well-being that are known to decrease with age. The objective of this study is to understand the effect of our MBT program on telomerase activity and stem cells in blood collected from the participants. Design: Here, we have investigated the effects of an intensive three weeks MBT retreat on telomerase activity and the peripheral blood stem cells in participants before and after the MBT. A total of 108 people were enrolled in the study; 38 men and 70 women (aged 18-90) randomly assigned for the study. Results: Telomerase activity was greater in retreat participants at the end of the MBT retreat. About 45% of people showed more than one-fold increase of telomerase activity after our MBT program. Furthermore, about 27% of people showed more pronounced fold increase (2-fold) in telomerase activity after the MBT. In addition, a substantial percentage of people (about 90%) exhibited increased stem cell counts after the MBT. Conclusions: The data suggest increased telomerase activity and stem cells count in peripheral blood from MBT retreat participants that may lead to increased longevity and better quality of life at latter age. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037072042

This may result in complex diseases, polygenic disorders and childhood cancers. Childhood cancer like retinoblastoma (RB) is more prevalent in developing countries and the incidence of RB has increased more than three fold in India in the last decade. Recent studies have documented increased incidence of cancers in children born to fathers who consume alcohol in excess and tobacco or who were conceived by assisted conception. The aetiology of childhood cancer and increased disease burden in these children is lin ked to oxidative stress (OS) and oxidative DNA damage( ODD) in sperm of their fathers. Though several antioxidants are in use to combat oxidative stress, the effect of majority of these formulations on DNA is not known. Yoga and meditation cause significant decline in OS and ODD and aid in regulating OS levels such that reactive oxygen speues meditated signal transduction, gene expression and several other physiological functions are not disrupted. Thus, this study aimed to analyze sperm ODD as a possible etiological factor in childhood cancer and role of simple life style interventions like yoga and meditation in significantly decreasing seminal oxidative stress and oxidative DNA damage and thereby decreasing incidence of childhood cancers. Materials and Methods: A total of 131 fathers of children with RB (non-familial sporadic heritable) and 50 controls (fathers of healthy children) were recruited at a tertiary center in India. Sperm parameters as per WHO 2010 guidelines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA fragmentation index (DFI), 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxy guanosine (8-OHdG) and telomere length were estimated at day 0, and after 3 and 6 months of intervention. We also examined the compliance with yoga and meditation practice and smoking status at each follow-up. Results: The seminal mean ROS levels (p<0.05), sperm DFI (p<0.001), 8-OHdG (p<0.01) levels were significantly higher in fathers of children with RB, as compared to controls and the relative mean telomere length in the sperm was shorter. Levels of ROS were significantly reduced in tobacco users (p<0.05) as well as in alcoholics (p<0.05) after intervention. DFI reduced significantly (p<0.05) after 6 months of yoga and meditation practice in all groups. The levels of oxidative DNA damage marker 8-OHdG were reduced significantly after 3 months (p<0.05) and 6 months (p<0.05) of practice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that OS and ODD DNA may contribute to the development of childhood cancer. This may be due to accumulation of oxidized mutagenic base 8OHdG, and elevated MDA levels which results in MDA dimers which are also mutagenic, aberrant methylation pattern, altered gene expression which affect cell proliferation and survival through activation of transcription factors. Increased mt DNA mutations and aberrant repair of mt and nuclear DNA due to highly truncatred DNA repair mechanisms all contribute to sperm genome hypermutability and persistant oxidative DNA damage. Oxidative stress is also associated with genome wide hypomethylation, telomere shortening and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to genome hypermutability and instability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report decline in OS and ODD and improvement in sperm DNA integrity following adoption of meditation and yoga based life style modification.This may reduce disease burden in next generation and reduce incidence of childhood cancers. © 2016, Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention.

Specifically, the book focuses on the systems biology studies of complex mechanisms, such as stress and inflammation. There is strong evidence supporting the close relationship between stress, inflammation, and disorders including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, skin diseases, and sleep disorders. As inflammation is a critical connection among different diseases, further elucidating this connection may contribute to the findings of systemic therapeutic targets. Translational medicine is also addressed, by applying PNI approaches in clinical practice. A major challenge in current bioscience is the translation of basic scientific discoveries into better clinical outcomes. With the understanding of the translational implications of PNI, integrative interventions can be applied to modulate stress responses and to promote healthier behaviors. As an important feature of this book, a broad overview of the PNI-associated integrative interventions is provided. These interventions include nutritional supplements, meditation, and other mind-body strategies. From basic concepts to systems methodologies, from theoretical sources to clinical applications, Psychoneuroimmunology contributes to the understanding and development of PNI toward the establishment of personalized and mind-body medicine. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008957055

Among many valuable metrics of health obtained from such wearable technology, heart rate variability (HRV) is one of the most promising continuous markers which is sensitive to both physiological and pathophysiological changes of the body. The aim of this study was to monitor HRV changes during Tai Chi. In order to monitor HRV, we used the wearable heart monitor FirstBeat Bodyguard 2, which was validated for accuracy and reliability. We then tested seven subjects (62.7±3.9 years) who perform Tai Chi regularly for more than one year. We found that HRV decreased during 30 minutes of Tai Chi (24-form Yang style), as expected for a moderate-type exercise that stimulates sympathetic influence. Secondly, we found that HRV had increased 30 minutes after Tai Chi, as expected for a mindful activity that stimulates parasympathetic activity. These are promising preliminary data. We anticipate that future data from more subjects and sophisticated analyses of HRV patterns during Tai Chi will help in monitoring individual autonomic regulation and better understanding the potential health benefits of mind-body exercises such as Tai Chi.

Exercise that challenges balance is proven to prevent falls. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to determine the impact of yoga-based exercise on balance and physical mobility in people aged 60+ years. Methods: searches for relevant trials were conducted on the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) from inception to February 2015. Trials were included if they evaluated the effect of physical yoga (excluding meditation and breathing exercises alone) on balance in people aged 60+ years. We extracted data on balance and the secondary outcome of physical mobility. Standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. Methodological quality of trials was assessed using the 10-point Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale. Results: six trials of relatively high methodological quality, totalling 307 participants, were identified and had data that could be included in a meta-analysis. Overall, yoga interventions had a small effect on balance performance (Hedges' g = 0.40, 95% CI 0.15-0.65, 6 trials) and a medium effect on physical mobility (Hedges' g = 0.50, 95% CI 0.06-0.95, 3 trials). Conclusion: yoga interventions resulted in small improvements in balance and medium improvements in physical mobility in people aged 60+ years. Further research is required to determine whether yoga-related improvements in balance and mobility translate to prevention of falls in older people.

Problems with using the consumer-grade EEG devices (BCI illiteracy, poor technical characteristics, and adverse EEG artefacts) are discussed. The experimental evaluation of the devices, performed with 10 subjects asked to perform concentration/relaxation and blinking recognition tasks, is given. The results of statistical analysis show that both devices exhibit high variability and non-normality of attention and meditation data, which makes each of them difficult to use as an input to control tasks. BCI illiteracy may be a significant problem, as well as setting up of the proper environment of the experiment. The results of blinking recognition show that using the Neurosky device means recognition accuracy is less than 50%, while the Emotiv device has achieved a recognition accuracy of more than 75%; for tasks that require concentration and relaxation of subjects, the Emotiv EPOC device has performed better (as measured by the recognition accuracy) by ~9%. Therefore, the Emotiv EPOC device may be more suitable for control tasks using the attention/meditation level or eye blinking than the Neurosky MindWave device. © 2016 Maskeliunas et al.","BCI; Consumer-grade EEG; Usability","attention; blinking; clinical article; consumer; electroencephalogram; human; leisure; meditation; recognition; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963972063

It claimed that any characteristic is determined by two factors. On the one hand, the Mendelian idea of the binary coding of characteristics was inspired by Christian Doppler, with whose department Mendel had been in contact for seven years. On the other hand, the regularities discovered by Mendel confirmed the intuitive notion of the divine principle based on rational foundations of Pythagoras living in the 6th century AD, who was the first to point to the spiritual grounds of being: the world was created by the number, and the number is a nonmaterial and insensuous entity. All students of heredity before Mendel traced the fate of a characteristic in the succession of generations. Instead, in order to unveil the heredity mechanism, Mendel traced the fates of two invisible factors that determined the characteristic. Probably, the ideas of binary combinations and mathematical probabilistic variants arose from Mendel’s long meditation and an imaginary experiment. Experiments on pea crosses were undertaken in order to test this speculative idea of a set of invisible determinants. Methods borrowed from statistical physics allowed Mendel to decipher the process occurring in the experiments with the pea model: the fate of a characteristic is determined by the action of two invisible factors. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","150th anniversary of genetics; Johann Gregor Mendel","Article; genetic code; genetic trait; heredity; mathematical model; pea; priority journal; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961793542

The subsequent generalized linear model analysis revealed group differences and a group-by-age interaction in all five selected regions.

In addition to a brief overview of CAM, the translational capacity from basic to clinical research to clinical practice will be described. Finally, a systematic approach to developing an adoptable evidence base, with proof of effectiveness based on the literature will be discussed. Inherent in this discussion will be the methodological and ethical challenges associated with CAM research in those with TBI and associated comorbidities, specifically in terms of how these challenges relate to practice and policy issues, implementation and dissemination.

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in 200 CKD patients who were on MHD. The patients were subjected to a validated interviewer-administered questionnaire adopted from the National Health Interview Survey Adult CAM. The knowledge on CAM and its usage by the patients were assessed based on the responses given by the patients. Results: Of the 200 patients, 52 (26%) patients were identified to be using CAM therapy. The most commonly used CAM modality by these patients was Ayurveda both alone (30.4%) and in combination with other CAM modalities (23.2%), followed by acupuncture in 17.3% patients. CAM usage was high in the age range of 50-64 years (67%). Of the CAM users, 21% of patients were from a rural area; 16.5% of patients were from upper middle class, and 24% were on dialysis for 1-4 years. There was a statistically significant association between CAM usage and age, gender, place of living, socioeconomic status, and duration of dialysis (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The present survey provides the data on the usage of CAM among dialysis patients and adds to the increasing evidence about CAM use. Because many products are at risk to either accumulate or cause interactions with medication, a better education on the risks and benefits of the CAM therapy by the health care providers to the end stage renal disease patients is needed. © 2016 Journal of Pharmacy And Bioallied Sciences | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Alternative medicine; complementary medicine; hemodialysis","herbaceous agent; adult; age distribution; alternative medicine; Article; Ayurveda; chiropractic; chronic kidney disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dialysis; diet supplementation; education; electromagnetic radiation; female; hemodialysis; homeopathy; human; hypnosis; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; marriage; massage; meditation; occupation; osteopathic medicine; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; Reiki; relaxation training; rural area; social status; spiritual healing; tertiary care center; touch; treatment duration; upper middle class; urban area; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955478623

In this form of depression, mothers may feel joy at a moment and then feel sorrow. They may feel sad, angry, grief or tired. Such feelings usually last only a few days; however, it may continue until a week or two. Such emotional waves are considered as a natural effect of hormonal changes caused by pregnancy and childbirth. The increased levels of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy suddenly drop after childbirth and this can affect the mother's mood. The level of these female hormones will be balanced during a week or more. As the hormone level returns to the balanced level, these feelings will spontaneously disappear without medical treatment. A mother who feels she is rejected, life is not worth living, or she thinks about suicide should immediately be visited by a doctor. Postpartum depression may last for several months or even more. With proper care, the patient can return to her normal life. In such a case, treatment may include visiting a counselor, meditation, or both. In addition, proper diet, exercise, rest and social support can be very helpful.

Methods The single Center, prospective, observational study included 10 subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma and 10 normal individuals, who performed the yoga exercises of Adho Mukha Svanasana, Uttanasana, Halasana and Viparita Karani for two minutes each. IOP was measured by pneumatonometry at baseline and during and after the exercises. Results All yoga poses were associated with a significant (P<0.01) rise in IOP within one minute after assuming the yoga position. The highest IOP increase (P<0.01) was measured in the Adho Mukha Svanasana position (IOP increase from 17±3.2 mmHg to 28±3.8 mmHg in glaucoma patients; from 17±2.8 mmHg to 29±3.9 mmHg in normal individuals), followed by the Uttanasana position (17±3.9 mmHg to 27±3.4 mmHg (glaucoma patients) and from 18 ±2.5 mmHg to 26±3.6 mmHg normal individuals)), the Halasana position (18±2.8 mmHg to 24±3.5 mmHg (glaucoma patients); 18±2.7 mmHg to 22±3.4 mmHg (normal individuals)), and finally the Viparita Kirani position (17±4 mmHg to 21±3.6 mmHg (glaucoma patients); 17±2.8 to 21±2.4 mmHg (normal individuals)). IOP dropped back to baseline values within two minutes after returning to a sitting position. Overall, IOP rise was not significantly different between glaucoma and normal subjects (P = 0.813), all though glaucoma eyes tended to have measurements 2 mm Hg higher on average. Conclusions Yoga exercises with head-down positions were associated with a rapid rise in IOP in glaucoma and healthy eyes. IOP returned to baseline values within 2 minutes.

However, it remains unclear whether compassion enhances altruistic behavior in a uniform way or is specific to sub-types of behavior such as altruistic helping of a victim or altruistic punishment of a transgressor.We investigated the relationship between compassion and subtypes of altruistic behavior using third-party paradigms where participants 1) witnessed an unfair economic exchange between a transgressor and a victim, and 2) had the opportunity to either spend personal funds to either economically a) help the victim or b) punish the transgressor. In Study 1, we examined whether individual differences in selfreported empathic concern (the emotional component of compassion) was associated with greater altruistic helping or punishment behavior in two independent samples. For participants who witnessed an unfair transaction, trait empathic concern was associated with greater helping of a victim and had no relationship to punishment. However, in those who decided to punish the transgressor, participants who reported greater empathic concern decided to punish less. In Study 2, we directly enhanced compassion using short-term online compassion meditation training to examine whether altruistic helping and punishment were increased after two weeks of training. Compared to an active reappraisal training control group, the compassion training group gave more to help the victim and did not differ in punishment of the transgressor. Together, these two studies suggest that compassion is related to greater altruistic helping of victims and is not associated with or may mitigate altruistic punishment of transgressors.

This systematic review assessed associated factors of risk of bias and consequences for the studies' conclusions in RCTs of yoga as one of the most commonly used complementary therapies. Methods: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, IndMED and the Cochrane Library were searched through February 2014 for yoga RCTs. Risk of selection bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool and regressed to a) publication year; b) country of origin; c) journal type; and d) impact factor using multiple logistic regression analysis. Likewise, the authors' conclusions were regressed to risk of bias. Results: A total of 312 RCTs were included. Impact factor ranged from 0.0 to 39.2 (median = 1.3); 60 RCT (19.2%) had a low risk of selection bias, and 252 (80.8%) had a high or unclear risk of selection bias. Only publication year and impact factor significantly predicted low risk of bias; RCTs published after 2001 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 12.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7, 94.0; p<0.001) and those published in journals with impact factor (adjusted OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.4, 4.9; p = 0.004) were more likely to have low risk of bias. The authors' conclusions were not associated with risk of bias. Conclusions: Risk of selection bias was generally high in RCTs of yoga; although the situation has improved since the publication of the revised CONSORT statement 2001. Pre-CONSORT RCTs and those published in journals without impact factor should be handled with increased care; although risk of bias is unlikely to distort the RCTs' conclusions. © 2015 Cramer et al.

Yoga is a traditional Indian practice that has been adapted for use in complementary and alternative medicine and mainly includes physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation. The impact of yoga as a complementary intervention for hypertension has been investigated in a number of randomized controlled trials; with an overall effect of about 10 mmHg reduction in systolic and about 8 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure. Yoga seems to be effective only for hypertension but not for prehypertension; and only as an adjunct to antihypertensive pharmacological treatment but not as an alternative therapy. Breathing and meditation rather than physical activity seem to be the active part of yoga interventions for hypertensive patients. These practices can increase parasympathic activity and decrease sympathetic activity, arguably mainly by increasing GABA activity; thus counteracting excess activity of the sympathetic nervous system which has been associated with hypertension. Although yoga has been associated with serious adverse events in single case reports, population-based surveys as well as clinical trials indicate that yoga is a relatively safe intervention that is not associated with more adverse events than other forms of physical activity. Yoga can thus be considered a safe and effective intervention for managing hypertension. Given the possibly better risk/benefit ratio, it may be advisable to focus on yogic meditation and/or breathing techniques. © 2016 J. A.

While there are numerous theories of personality, temperament, and character, few seem to take advantage of parsimonious taxonomy. The present study sought to implement this taxonomy by creating a questionnaire based on a categorization of behavioral temperaments/tendencies first identified in Buddhist accounts over fifteen hundred years ago. Items were developed using historical and contemporary texts of the behavioral temperaments, described as ""Greedy/Faithful"", ""Aversive/Discerning"", and ""Deluded/Speculative"". To both maintain this categorical typology and benefit from the advantageous properties of forced-choice response format (e.g., reduction of response biases), binary pairwise preferences for items were modeled using Latent Class Analysis (LCA). One sample (n1 = 394) was used to estimate the item parameters, and the second sample (n2 = 504) was used to classify the participants using the established parameters and cross-validate the classification against multiple other measures. The cross-validated measure exhibited good nomothetic span (construct-consistent relationships with related measures) that seemed to corroborate the ideas present in the original Buddhist source documents. The final 13-block questionnaire created from the best performing items (the Behavioral Tendencies Questionnaire or BTQ) is a psychometrically valid questionnaire that is historically consistent, based in behavioral tendencies, and promises practical and clinical utility particularly in settings that teach and study meditation practices such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). © 2015 Van Dam et al.

However, the evidence of efficacy of other interventions based on short-bouts of exercise (circuit training, CT), and the practice of breath-control and meditation (relaxing training, RT) is growing. The aim of this study was to elucidate if CT or RT are equally effective in CVD risk factors reduction compared to ET. To this purpose, in 40 elderly participants, with clinically diagnosed grade 1 hypertension, resting blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol levels, peak oxygen uptake (V˙o2peak), mechanical efficiency and quality of life were evaluated before and after 12 weeks of ET, CT, and RT treatments. Resting blood pressure reduced significantly in all groups by ∼11 %. In ET, blood cholesterol levels (−18 %), V˙o2peak (+8 %), mechanical efficiency (+9 %), and quality of life scores (+36 %) ameliorated. In CT blood glucose levels (−11 %), V˙o2peak (+7 %) and quality of life scores (+35 %) were bettered. Conversely, in RT, the lower blood pressure went along only with an improvement in the mental component of quality of life (+42 %). ET and CT were both appropriate interventions to reduce CVDs risk factors, because blood pressure reduction was accompanied by decreases in blood glucose and cholesterol levels, increases in V˙o2peak, mechanical efficiency, and quality of life. Although RT influenced only blood pressure and quality of life, this approach would be an attractive alternative for old individuals unable or reluctant to carry out ET or CT. © 2015, American Aging Association.","Aging; Blood pressure; Cardiovascular disease; Circuit training; Endurance training; Relaxing training","cholesterol; glucose; aged; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; circuit training; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; endurance training; expiratory flow; female; glucose blood level; human; hypertension; lung gas exchange; male; oxygen consumption; patient compliance; quality of life; range of motion; relaxation training; risk reduction; treatment duration; aging; endurance; hypertension; kinesiotherapy; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; rest; risk factor; Aged; Aging; Blood Pressure; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Physical Endurance; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Rest; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942085166

This study explores this among undergraduates in Sri Lanka. Methods: A total of 4671 undergraduates responded to a survey presenting a vignette of a depressed undergraduate. They were asked to identify the problem, describe their intended help-seeking actions if affected by it and rate the helpfulness of a range of help-providers and interventions for dealing with it. Mental health experts also rated these options, providing a benchmark for assessing the undergraduates' responses. Results: Only 17.4 % of undergraduates recognised depression, but this was significantly lower among those responding in Sinhala compared to English (3.5 vs 36.8 %). More undergraduates indicated intentions of seeking informal help, such as from friends and parents, than from professionals, such as psychiatrists and counsellors. However, a majority rated all these help-providers as 'helpful', aligning with expert opinion. Other options recommended by experts and rated as 'helpful' by a large proportion of undergraduates included counselling/psychological therapy and self-help strategies such as doing enjoyable activities and meditation/yoga/relaxation exercises. However, a low proportion of undergraduates rated ""western medicine to improve mood"" as 'helpful', deviating from expert opinion. Although not endorsed by experts, undergraduates indicated intentions of using religious strategies, highly endorsing these as 'helpful'. Labelling the problem as depression and using mental health-related labels were both associated with higher odds of endorsing professional help, with the label 'depression' associated with endorsing a wider range of professional options. Conclusions: The recognition rate of depression might be associated with the language used to label it. These undergraduates' knowledge about the use of medication for depression needs improvement. Health promotion interventions for depressed undergraduates must be designed in light of the prevalent socio-cultural backdrop, such as the undergraduates' high endorsement of informal and culturally relevant help-seeking. Improving their ability to recognise the problem as being mental health-related might trigger their use of professional options of help. © 2015 Amarasuriya et al.","Beliefs; Cultural differences; Depression; Depression literacy; Help-seeking; Intentions; Labelling; Mental health literacy; Recognition; Undergraduate","adolescent; adult; attitude to health; cross-sectional study; depression; directive counseling; female; human; language; male; meditation; pathophysiology; patient attitude; procedures; psychology; psychotherapy; questionnaire; relaxation training; Sri Lanka; student; university; yoga; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Directive Counseling; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Language; Male; Meditation; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Psychotherapy; Relaxation Therapy; Sri Lanka; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945201047

Aim: To determine prevalence, predictors, and reasons for CAM use among all patients attending a gastrointestinal (GI) clinic in a single academic center. Methods: Adults attending outpatient GI clinics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center completed a questionnaire to assess CAM utilization as well as perceived benefits, harms, and costs of CAM therapy. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare statistical differences between CAM and non-CAM users. Results: Survey questionnaires were completed by 269 patients. Prevalence of CAM use was 44 % (95 % CI 38–50). Users were more likely to be female (81 vs. 56 %, p < 0.01) and dissatisfied with conventional treatment (22 vs. 8 %, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in age, race, education, income, GI diagnosis, and duration of symptoms between the two groups. Users reported “wish to feel generally better” as main reason for utilization, and a majority of patients (62 %) experienced improved GI symptoms. Among patients who did not discuss CAM with their physicians (30 %), they cited physician failure to ask about CAM as the major reason (82 %). Conclusion: CAM is prevalent among patients attending a GI clinic, particularly among women and those who are dissatisfied with conventional therapies and “wish to feel better.” Greater awareness and understanding of CAM among GI physicians is necessary. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Alternative medicine; CAM; Complementary medicine; Dietary supplements; Gastrointestinal diseases; Probiotics","betaine; cascara; curcumin; fish oil; glutamine; herbaceous agent; peppermint oil; prebiotic agent; probiotic agent; thioctic acid; ubidecarenone; acupuncture; adolescent; adult; age; aged; allopathy; alternative medicine; Arnica; bloating; chiropractic; constipation; controlled study; diarrhea; disease duration; educational status; female; garlic; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal symptom; ginger; gluten free diet; Glycyrrhiza; health care cost; health care utilization; homeopathy; human; hypnosis; income; inflammatory bowel disease; irritable colon; kinesiology; linseed; major clinical study; male; massage; meditation; moxibustion; paleolithic diet; papaya; physician; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; race difference; reflexology; Reiki; Review; Senna; sex difference; Tai Chi; Gastrointestinal Diseases; middle aged; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Aged; Complementary Therapies; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Young Adult",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930822462

Cognitive dysfunctions are an integral part of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in healthy ageing. Cognitive Enhancers are molecules that help improve aspects of cognition like memory, intelligence, motivation, attention and concentration. Recently, Non Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancers have gained popularity as effective and safe alternative to various established drugs. Many of these Non Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancers seem to be more efficacious compared to currently available Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancers. This review describes and summarizes evidence on various Non Pharmacological Cognitive Enhancers such as physical exercise, sleep, meditation and yoga, spirituality, nutrients, computer training, brain stimulation, and music. We also discuss their role in ageing and different neuro-psychiatric disorders, and current status of Cochrane database recommendations. We searched the Pubmed database for the articles and reviews having the terms ‘non pharmacological and cognitive’ in the title, published from 2000 till 2014.

The number of survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is growing rapidly and HCT clinicians are aware that many of their patients use CAM therapies consistently. However, due to a paucity of data regarding the benefits and harms of CAM therapies in these survivors, clinicians are reluctant to provide specific recommendations for or against particular CAM therapies. A systematic literature review was conducted with a search using PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ovid online for each CAM therapy as defined by the National Center of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The search generated 462 references, of which 26 articles were deemed to be relevant for the review. Due to extensive heterogeneity in data and limited randomized trials, a meta-analysis could not be performed but a comprehensive systematic review was conducted with specified outcomes for each CAM therapy. In randomized controlled trials, certain mind and body interventions such as relaxation were observed to be effective in alleviating psychological symptoms in patients undergoing HCT, whereas the majority of the other CAM treatments were found to have mixed results. CAM use is an understudied area in HCT survivorship and clinicians should convey the benefits and uncertainties concerning the role of CAM therapies to their patients.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effects of a 12-week traditional Hatha yoga and meditation intervention on menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. METHODS Patients were randomly assigned either to a 12-week yoga and meditation intervention or to usual care. The primary outcome measure was total menopausal symptoms (Menopause Rating Scale [MRS] total score). Secondary outcome measures included MRS subscales, quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue), depression, and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Outcomes were assessed at week 12 and week 24 after randomization. RESULTS In total, 40 women (mean age ± standard deviation, 49.2 ± 5.9 years) were randomized to yoga (n = 19) or to usual care (n = 21). Women in the yoga group reported significantly lower total menopausal symptoms compared with the usual care group at week 12 (mean difference, -5.6; 95% confidence interval, -9.2 to -1.9; P = .004) and at week 24 (mean difference, -4.5; 95% confidence interval, -8.3 to -0.7; P = .023). At week 12, the yoga group reported less somatovegetative, psychological, and urogenital menopausal symptoms; less fatigue; and improved quality of life (all P < .05). At week 24, all effects persisted except for psychological menopausal symptoms. Short-term effects on menopausal symptoms remained significant when only women who were receiving antiestrogen medication (n = 36) were analyzed. Six minor adverse events occurred in each group. CONCLUSIONS Yoga combined with meditation can be considered a safe and effective complementary intervention for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors. The effects seem to persist for at least 3 months.

OBJECTIVE: Here, we studied the characteristics of two electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns evoked by two different imaginary tasks and evaluated the binary classification performance. METHODS: Fifteen individuals (11 male and 4 female, age range of 22 to 33) participated in five sessions of 32-channel EEG recordings. Only by analyzing the subjects' output EEG signals from the central parieto-occipital region of PZ electrode, under the circumstances of consciousness of relaxation-meditation or tension-imagination, we carried out the experiment of feature extraction for spontaneous EEG, as the subjects were blindfolded but asked to open their eyes all the same. The Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was utilized to obtain the Hilbert time-frequency amplitude spectrum, and then with the feature vector set extracted, a two-class Fisher linear discriminant analysis classifier was trained for classification of data epochs of those two tasks. RESULTS: The overall result was that about 90% (± 5%) of the epochs could be correctly classified to their originating task. CONCLUSION: This study not only brings new opportunities for consciousness studies, but also provides a new classification paradigm for achieving control of robots based on the brain-computer interface (BCI). © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

The purpose of this investigation was to carry out a systematic review of previous meta-analyses that examined the effects of meditative movement therapies (yoga, tai chi and qigong) on HRQOL in adults. Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials published up through February, 2014 were included by searching nine electronic databases and cross-referencing. Dual-selection and data abstraction occurred. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews Instrument (AMSTAR) was used to assess methodological quality. Standardized mean differences that were pooled using random-effects models were included. In addition, 95% prediction intervals were calculated as well as the number needed-to-treat and percentile improvements. Of the 510 citations screened, 10 meta-analyses representing a median of 3 standardized mean differences in 82 to 528 participants (median = 270) with breast cancer, schizophrenia, low back pain, heart failure and diabetes, were included. Median methodological quality was 70%. Median length, frequency and duration of the meditative movement therapies were 12 weeks, 3 times per week, for 71 minutes per session. The majority of results (78.9%) favored statistically significant improvements (non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals) in HRQOL, with standardized mean differences ranging from 0.18 to 2.28. More than half of the results yielded statistically significant heterogeneity (Q ≤ 0.10) and large or very large inconsistency (I2 ≥ 50%). All 95% prediction intervals included zero. The number-needed-to-treat ranged from 2 to 10 while percentile improvements ranged from 9.9 to 48.9. The results of this study suggest that meditative movement therapies may improve HRQOL in adults with selected conditions. However, a need exists for a large, more inclusive meta-analysis (PROSPERO Registration #CRD42014014576). © 2015 Kelley, Kelley.

Thus, the aims of this study were to (1) estimate the prevalence of meditation practice, (2) identify the characteristics of individuals who practice meditation, and (3) examine the association between meditation practice and job performance. Two population-based, cross-sectional surveys were conducted. In study 1, we examined the prevalence of meditation practice and the characteristics of the persons practicing meditation; in Study 2, we examined the association between meditation practice and job performance. The outcome variables included work engagement, subjective job performance, and job satisfaction. The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale was used to assess work engagement, the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ) was used to measure subjective job performance, and a scale developed by the Japanese government was used to assess job satisfaction. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used in Study 2. Demographic characteristics and behavioral risk factors were included as covariates in the analyses. The results of Study 1 indicated that 3.9% of persons surveyed (n=30,665) practiced meditation; these individuals were younger and had a higher education, higher household income, higher stress level, and lower body mass index than those who did not practice meditation. The results of Study 2 (n=1,470) indicated that meditation practice was significantly predictive of work engagement (β=0.112, p <.001), subjective job performance (β=0.116, p <.001), and job satisfaction (β=0.079, p=.002), even after adjusting for covariates (β=0.083, p <.001; β=0.104, p <.001; β=0.060, p=.015, respectively). The results indicate that meditation practice may positively influence job performance, including job satisfaction, subjective job performance, and work engagement. © 2015 Shiba et al.

We therefore assumed that the burden of disease combined with the lack of adequate treatment leaves open a big market for complementary and alternative medicine use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use and perceived effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in children and adults with genetically proven mitochondrial disease. The reported use was surprisingly high, with 88 % of children and 91 % of adults having used some kind of complementary and alternative medicine in the last 2 years. Also, the mean cost of these treatments was impressive, being €489/year for children and €359/year for adult patients. Over-the-counter remedies (e.g., food supplements, homeopathy) and self-help techniques (e.g., Reiki, yoga) were the most frequently used complementary and alternative therapies in our cohort: 54 % of children and 60 % of adults reported the various complementary and alternative medicine therapies to be effective. Given the fact that currently no effective treatment exists, further research toward the different therapies is needed, as our study clearly demonstrates that such therapies are highly sought after by affected patients. © 2014, SSIEM.",,"acupuncture; adolescent; adult; aged; alternative medicine; aromatherapy; Article; child; Chinese medicine; chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia; clinical effectiveness; clinical research; cohort analysis; controlled study; diet supplementation; disorders of mitochondrial functions; female; healing; health care cost; homeopathy; human; hypnosis; Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; major clinical study; male; meditation; phytotherapy; prevalence; Reiki; relaxation training; school child; self help; treatment duration; yoga; alternative medicine; economics; middle aged; Mitochondrial Diseases; perception; preschool child; procedures; questionnaire; treatment outcome; young adult; non prescription drug; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Complementary Therapies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Diseases; Nonprescription Drugs; Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929166034

Mindful attention has been shown to attenuate sensory habituation in expert meditators; however, others were not able to replicate this effect. The present study used acoustic startle reflex to investigate the effect of mindfulness practice intensity on sensory habituation. Methods: Auditory Startle Response (ASR) to 36 startling probes (12 trials x 3 block with 40ms inter-block intervals), was measured using electromyography (EMG) in three groups of participants (N = 12/group): meditation-naïve, moderate practice, and intensive practice. Results: Intensive practice group showed attenuated startle habituation as evidenced by significantly less habituation over the entire experiment relative to the meditation-naïve and moderate practice groups. Furthermore, there was a significant linear effect showing between-block habituation in meditation-naïve and moderate practice groups, but not in the intensive practice group. However, the Block x Group interaction between the intensive practice and the meditation-naive groups was not significant. Moderate practice group was not significantly different from the meditation-naïve in the overall measure of habituation, but showed significantly stronger habituation than both meditation-naïve and intensive practice groups in Block 1. Greater practice intensity was significantly correlated with slower overall habituation and habituation rate in Blocks 2 and 3 in the intensive, but not in the moderate, practice group. Conclusions: The study provides tentative evidence that intensive mindfulness practice attenuates acoustic startle habituation as measured by EMG, but the effect is modest. Moderate practice, on the other hand, appears to enhance habituation, suggesting the effect of mindfulness practice on startle habituation might be non-liner. Better understanding of the effect of mindful attention on startle habituation may shed new light on sensory information processing capacity of the human brain and its potential for de-automatisation of hardwired processes. © 2015 Antonova et al.",,"acoustic reflex; adult; Article; auditory startle response; auditory stimulation; electromyography; eyelid reflex; female; habituation; human; human experiment; intensive mindfulness practice; intermethod comparison; male; meditation; middle aged; mindfulness; moderate mindfulness practice; monitor; normal human; response time; self evaluation; sensory gating; startle reflex; startle response monitoring system; stimulus response; attention; learning; startle reflex; Adult; Attention; Female; Habituation, Psychophysiologic; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Practice (Psychology); Reflex, Startle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093867

We conducted a secondary data analysis of a nationwide, multi-site, phase II/III randomized, controlled, clinical trial examining the efficacy of yoga for improving musculoskeletal symptoms among breast cancer survivors currently receiving hormone therapy (aromatase inhibitors [AI] or tamoxifen [TAM]). Breast cancer survivors currently receiving AI (N = 95) or TAM (N = 72) with no participation in yoga during the previous 3 months were randomized into 2 arms: (1) standard care monitoring and (2) standard care plus the 4-week yoga intervention (2x/week; 75 min/session) and included in this analysis. The yoga intervention utilized the UR Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS©®) program consisting of breathing exercises, 18 gentle Hatha and restorative yoga postures, and meditation. Musculoskeletal symptoms were assessed pre- and post-intervention. At baseline, AI users reported higher levels of general pain, muscle aches, and total physical discomfort than TAM users (all P ≤ 0.05). Among all breast cancer survivors on hormonal therapy, participants in the yoga group demonstrated greater reductions in musculoskeletal symptoms such as general pain, muscle aches and total physical discomfort from pre- to post-intervention than the control group (all P ≤ 0.05). The severity of musculoskeletal symptoms was higher for AI users compared to TAM users.

Targeted interventions are needed to address the needs of this vulnerable group. METHODS This randomized trial provided the first evaluation of a brief, mindfulness-based intervention for younger breast cancer survivors designed to reduce stress, depression, and inflammatory activity. Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at or before age 50 who had completed cancer treatment were randomly assigned to a 6-week Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPS) intervention group (n = 39) or to a wait-list control group (n = 32). Participants completed questionnaires before and after the intervention to assess stress and depressive symptoms (primary outcomes) as well as physical symptoms, cancer-related distress, and positive outcomes. Blood samples were collected to examine genomic and circulating markers of inflammation. Participants also completed questionnaires at a 3-month follow-up assessment. RESULTS In linear mixed models, the MAPS intervention led to significant reductions in perceived stress (P = .004) and marginal reductions in depressive symptoms (P = .094), as well as significant reductions in proinflammatory gene expression (P = .009) and inflammatory signaling (P = .001) at postintervention. Improvements in secondary outcomes included reduced fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms and increased peace and meaning and positive affect (P < .05 for all). Intervention effects on psychological and behavioral measures were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up assessment, although reductions in cancer-related distress were observed at that assessment.

Modifiable lifestyle factors have been recognized as having a role in a range of morbidity outcomes in PwMS. There is significant potential to prevent and treat fatigue in PwMS by addressing modifiable risk factors. Objectives: To explore the associations between clinically significant fatigue and demographic factors, clinical factors (health-related quality of life, disability and relapse rate) and modifiable lifestyle, disease-modifying drugs (DMD) and supplement use in a large international sample of PwMS. Methods: PwMS were recruited to the study via Web 2.0 platforms and completed a comprehensive survey measuring demographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics, including healthrelated quality of life, disability, and relapse rate. Results: Of 2469 participants with confirmed MS, 2138 (86.6%) completed a validated measure of clinically significant fatigue, the Fatigue Severity Scale. Participants were predominantly female from English speaking countries, with relatively high levels of education, and due to recruitment methods may have been highly pro-active about engaging in lifestyle management and self-help. Approximately two thirds of our sample (1402/2138;65.6% (95% CI 63.7-67.7)) screened positive for clinically significant fatigue. Bivariate associations were present between clinically significant fatigue and several demographic, clinical, lifestyle, and medication variables. After controlling for level of disability and a range of stable socio-demographic variables, we found increased odds of fatigue associated with obesity, DMD use, poor diet, and reduced odds of fatigue with exercise, fish consumption, moderate alcohol use, and supplementation with vitamin D and flaxseed oil. Conclusion: This study supports strong and significant associations between clinically significant fatigue and modifiable lifestyle factors. Longitudinal follow-up of this sample may help clarify the contribution of reverse causation to our findings. Further research is required to explore these associations including randomized controlled trials of lifestyle interventions that may alleviate fatigue. © 2015 Weiland et al.",,"fish oil; omega 3 fatty acid; vitamin D; adult; age; alcohol consumption; Article; birthplace; comorbidity; demography; diet; disability; disease activity; disease association; disease duration; eating habit; educational status; employment status; exercise; fatigue; Fatigue Severity Scale; female; fish; food intake; health behavior; human; lifestyle; linseed; major clinical study; male; marriage; multiple sclerosis; obesity; prevalence; quality of life; relapse; self help; self report; sex difference; smoking habit; vitamin supplementation; complication; drinking behavior; fatigue; international cooperation; Internet; meditation; middle aged; multiple sclerosis; questionnaire; smoking; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Exercise; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Internationality; Internet; Life Style; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923276711

However, the robustness, underlying mechanisms, and potential scalability of such effects remain open to question. The current experiment employed an ecologically valid situation that exposed participants to a person in visible pain. Following three-week, mobile-app based training courses in mindfulness meditation or cognitive skills (i.e., an active control condition), participants arrived at a lab individually to complete purported measures of cognitive ability. Upon entering a public waiting area outside the lab that contained three chairs, participants seated themselves in the last remaining unoccupied chair; confederates occupied the other two. As the participant sat and waited, a third confederate using crutches and a large walking boot entered the waiting area while displaying discomfort. Compassionate responding was assessed by whether participants gave up their seat to allow the uncomfortable confederate to sit, thereby relieving her pain. Participants' levels of empathic accuracy was also assessed. As predicted, participants assigned to the mindfulness meditation condition gave up their seats more frequently than did those assigned to the active control group. In addition, empathic accuracy was not increased by mindfulness practice, suggesting that mindfulness-enhanced compassionate behavior does not stem from associated increases in the ability to decode the emotional experiences of others.

Periods of persistent and intensive demands may compromise attention and increase off-task thinking. Here, we investigated if MT may mitigate these deleterious effects and promote cognitive resilience in military cohorts enduring a high-demand interval of predeployment training. To better understand which aspects of MT programs are most beneficial, three military cohorts were examined. Two of the three groups were provided MT. One group received an 8-hour, 8-week variant of Mindfulness-based Mind Fitness Training (MMFT) emphasizing engagement in training exercises (training-focused MT, n = 40), a second group received a didacticfocused variant emphasizing content regarding stress and resilience (didactic-focused MT, n = 40), and the third group served as a no-training control (NTC, n = 24). Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) performance was indexed in all military groups and a notraining civilian group (CIV, n = 45) before (T1) and after (T2) the MT course period. Attentional performance (measured by A', a sensitivity index) was lower in NTC vs. CIV at T2, suggesting that performance suffers after enduring a high-demand predeployment interval relative to a similar time period of civilian life. Yet, there were significantly fewer performance lapses in the military cohorts receiving MT relative to NTC, with training-focused MT outperforming didactic-focused MT at T2. From T1 to T2, A' degraded in NTC and didacticfocused MT but remained stable in training-focused MT and CIV. In sum, while protracted periods of high-demand military training may increase attentional performance lapses, practice-focused MT programs akin to training-focused MT may bolster attentional performance more than didactic-focused programs. As such, training-focused MT programs should be further examined in cohorts experiencing protracted high-demand intervals. © 2015 Jha et al.",,"adult; analysis of variance; army; Article; attention; autoregulation; awareness; cognition; controlled study; coping behavior; female; human; human experiment; male; meditation; mental capacity; mental health; military deployment; mindfulness; normal human; psychological aspect; quasi experimental study; relaxation training; response time; training; cohort analysis; randomized controlled trial; self report; soldier; time factor; young adult; Attention; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Military Personnel; Mindfulness; Self Report; Time Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923233704

Although telomere length (TL) has been associated with breast cancer prognosis, the impact of these two interventions on TL has not been studied to date. METHODS: The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of MBCR and SET with a minimal intervention control condition (a 1-day stress management seminar) on TL in distressed breast cancer survivors in a randomized controlled trial. MBCR focused on training in mindfulness meditation and gentle Hatha yoga whereas SET focused on emotional expression and group support. The primary outcome measure was relative TL, the telomere/single-copy gene ratio, assessed before and after each intervention. Secondary outcomes were self-reported mood and stress symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-eight distressed breast cancer survivors with a diagnosis of stage I to III cancer (using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system) who had completed treatment at least 3 months prior participated. Using analyses of covariance on a per-protocol sample, there were no differences noted between the MBCR and SET groups with regard to the telomere/single-copy gene ratio, but a trend effect was observed between the combined intervention group and controls (F [1,84], 3.82; P = .054; η2 = .043); TL in the intervention group was maintained whereas it was found to decrease for control participants. There were no associations noted between changes in TL and changes in mood or stress scores over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial interventions providing stress reduction and emotional support resulted in trends toward TL maintenance in distressed breast cancer survivors, compared with decreases in usual care. © 2014 The Authors.

In this study, we explored four key questions concerning mindfulness training: (1) What are the processes by which mindfulness regulates our emotions? (2) Can mindfulness be applied to social emotions? (3) Does mindfulness training affect emotionally driven behavior towards others? (4) Does mindfulness alter physiological reactivity? To address these questions, we tested, in two experiments, the ability of mindfulness meditators to regulate interpersonal emotions (Experiment 1) and interactive behaviors (Experiment 2) as compared to naïve controls. To better understand the mechanisms by which mindfulness regulates emotions, we asked participants to apply two strategies: a cognitive strategy (mentalizing, a form of reappraisal focused on the intentions of others) and an experiential strategy derived from mindfulness principles (mindful detachment). Both groups were able to regulate interpersonal emotions by means of cognitive (mentalizing) and experiential (mindful detachment) strategies. In Experiment 1, a simple effect of meditation, independent from the implementation of the strategies, resulted in reduced emotional and physiological reactivity, as well as in increased pleasantness for meditators when compared to controls, providing evidence of baseline regulation. In Experiment 2, one visible effect of the strategy was that meditators outperformed controls in the experiential (mindful detachment) but not in the cognitive (mentalize) strategy, showing stronger modulation of their interactive behavior (less punishments) and providing evidence of a strategic behavioral regulation. Based on these results, we suggest that mindfulness can influence interpersonal emotional reactions through an experiential mechanism, both at a baseline level and a strategic level, thereby altering the subjective and physiological perception of emotions, but also biasing interactive social behavior. © 2015 Grecucci et al.",,"adult; Article; cognition; controlled study; emotionality; human; human experiment; meditation; mindfulness; normal human; perception; questionnaire; social behavior; anxiety; anxiety disorder; behavior; depression; emotion; human relation; mindfulness; physiology; procedures; psychology; theory of mind; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior; Depression; Emotions; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Meditation; Mindfulness; Theory of Mind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921038709

It has been shown previously that intensive or prolonged mind and body therapies (MBT) may have beneficial effects on the well-being of healthy people and in patients. Telomerase activity and levels of peripheral blood adult pluripotent stem cells (PB-APSC) are reliable markers of long-term well-being that are known to decrease with age. The objective of this study is to understand the effect of our MBT program on telomerase activity and stem cells in blood collected from the participants. Design: Here, we have investigated the effects of an intensive three weeks MBT retreat on telomerase activity and the peripheral blood stem cells in participants before and after the MBT. A total of 108 people were enrolled in the study; 38 men and 70 women (aged 18-90) randomly assigned for the study. Results: Telomerase activity was greater in retreat participants at the end of the MBT retreat. About 45% of people showed more than one-fold increase of telomerase activity after our MBT program. Furthermore, about 27% of people showed more pronounced fold increase (2-fold) in telomerase activity after the MBT. In addition, a substantial percentage of people (about 90%) exhibited increased stem cell counts after the MBT. Conclusions: The data suggest increased telomerase activity and stem cells count in peripheral blood from MBT retreat participants that may lead to increased longevity and better quality of life at latter age. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"telomerase; telomerase; adolescent; adult; adult stem cell; aged; aging; Article; cell count; controlled study; enzyme activity; female; human; human cell; integrative medicine; intervention study; life extension; longevity; male; middle aged; mind and body therapy; normal human; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; peripheral blood stem cell; psychological well being; psychotherapy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; rejuvenation; stem cell count; telomere shortening; young adult; adult stem cell; alternative medicine; blood; blood cell count; cytology; metabolism; physiology; procedures; psychology; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Adult Stem Cells; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Blood Cell Count; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Therapies; Telomerase; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959342941

Tremendous progress has been made in the field of medicine in recent years. Modern medicine as well as yoga has scientific basis and a universal outlook. It is gratifying that science has started acknowledging the effects of yogic techniques, whereas yoga has started using modern technology and scientific methods. Prana is energy; when the self-energizing force embraces the body with extension, expansion, and control, it is called pranayama. Suryanamaskar is the combination of asana and pranayama. They affect the milieu at the bronchioles and the alveoli particularly at the alveolocapillary membrane to facilitate diffusion and transport of gases. It may also increase oxygenation at tissue level. They have been integrated into physical education in many public and private medical schools across the world. The goal of this study was to identify the effect of pranayama and suryanamaskar on dynamic spirometric functions. Aims &amp; Objective: To investigate the effect of pranayama and suryanamaskar on various dynamic spirometric values (i.e., FVC (L), FEV1 (L), FEV3 (L), FEF25–75% (L), VC (L), FEV1/FVC (%), and PEFR (L/s) after 6 months of a training program. Materials and Methods: The duration of the study was 6 months. The participants were divided into four groups namely control, pranayama, suryanamaskar, and combined group of pranayama and suryanamaskar. On the first day of the study, the subjects came to a training room and the following tests were conducted. The parameters for lung functions were forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in 3 seconds (FEV3), FEV1/FVC, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). The exercise regimen for pranayama and suryanamaskar included the following yogic procedures: bhastrika pranayama, kapalbhati pranayama, bhramari pranayama, nadi suddi/anulom vilom pranayama, pranava pranayama, and Suryanamaskar. Results: The VC, FVC, FEV1, FEV3, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, and FEF25–75% values were highly significant in the pranayama group (group II) than the suryanamaskara group (group III). All the above values were highly significant (p &lt; 0.05) in the combined group (group IV) when compared to the other groups. Conclusion: Pranayama and suryanamaskara practice exerts more beneficial effects than physical exercise that mostly affects dimensions of the thoracic cavity. Yoga is a technique of controlling and modulating breath and meditation, a process through which one attains a state of deep rest yet active state of mind. Recent studies on long-term yogic practices have shown improvement in respiratory functions. This aspect of relaxation and detachment has not been mentioned in our education process and it is this new dimension of yoga training that needs to be added to the curriculum. It can make students physically fit and enhance the learning process. © 2015 Mrs Deepika Charan.

Parents need to be aware that germ cell integrity is vital for birth of healthy offspring as biological parenting begins much before birth of a child and even before conception. The present study was conducted to determine the etiology of non-familial sporadic heritable retinoblastoma (NFSHRb), by evaluating oxidative sperm DNA damage in fathers due to use of tobacco (smoking and chewing). Materials and Methods: We recruited 145 fathers of NFSHRb children and 53 fathers of healthy children (controls) in the study. Tobacco history was obtained by personal interview. Seminal reactive oxygen species (ROS) in semen, sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and 8 hydroxy 2' deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in sperm were evaluated. The RB1 gene was screened in genomic blood DNA of parents of children with NFSHRb and controls. Odds ratios (ORs) derived from conditional logistic regression models. Results: There was significant difference in the levels of ROS (p<0.05), DFI (p<0.05) and 8-OHdG (p<0.05) between tobacco users and non-users. The OR of NFSHRb for smokers was 7.29 (95%CI 2.9-34.5, p<0.01), for tobacco chewers 4.75 (2.07-10.9, p<0.05) and for both 9.11 (3.79-39.2; p<0.01). Conclusions: This study emphasizes the adverse effect of tobacco on the paternal genome and how accumulation of oxidative damage in sperm DNA may contribute to the etiology of NFSHRb. In an ongoing parallel study in our laboratory, 11 of fathers who smoked underwent. Meditation and yoga interventions, showed significant decline in levels of highly mutagenic oxidised DNA adducts after 6 months. Thus our lifestyle and social habits impact sperm DNA integrity and simple interventions like yoga and meditation are therapeutic for oxidative damage to sperm DNA.","Childhood cancer; Oxidative stress; Retinoblastoma; Smokers; Sperm DNA damage; Tobacco","8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine; deoxyguanosine; DNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; retinoblastoma protein; adult; adverse effects; analogs and derivatives; blood; case control study; DNA fragmentation; genetics; human; infant; male; metabolism; oxidative stress; paternal exposure; Retinal Neoplasms; retinoblastoma; spermatozoon; tobacco use; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Deoxyguanosine; DNA; DNA Fragmentation; Humans; Infant; Male; Oxidative Stress; Paternal Exposure; Reactive Oxygen Species; Retinal Neoplasms; Retinoblastoma; Retinoblastoma Protein; Spermatozoa; Tobacco Use; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948139208

Pain is one of the negative experiences of lung cancer. Cognitive behavioral therapy techniques are often recommended as treatments for lung cancer pain. The objective of this review was to synthesize the evidence on the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy techniques in treating lung cancer pain. This review considered studies that included lung cancer patients who were required to 1) be at least 18 years old; 2) speak and read English or Thai; 3) have a life expectancy of at least two months; 4) experience daily cancer pain requiring an opioid medication; 5) have a positive response to opioid medication; 6) have ""average or usual"" pain between 4 and 7 on a scale of 0-10 for the day before the clinic visit or for a typical day; and 7) able to participate in a pain evaluation and treatment program. This review considered studies to examine interventions for use in treatment of pain in lung cancer patients, including: biofeedback, cognitive/attentional distraction, imagery, hypnosis, and meditation. Any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for pain specifically in lung cancer patients were included. In the absence of RCTs, quasi-experimental designs were reviewed for possible conclusion in a narrative summary. Outcome measures were pain intensity before and after cognitive behavioural therapy techniques. The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished literature. A three-step search was utilised by using identified keywords and text term. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all the identified keywords and index terms was then undertaken across all included databases. Thirdly, the reference list of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. Searches were conducted during January 1991- March 2014 limited to English and Thai languages with no date restriction. Materials and Methods: All studies that met the inclusion criteria were assessed for methodological quality by three reviewers using a standardized critical appraisal tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Three reviewers extracted data independently, using a standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Ideally for quantitative data meta-analysis was to be conducted where all results were subject to double data entry. Odds ratios (for categorical data) and weighted mean differences (for continuous data) and their 95% confidence intervals were to be calculated for analysis and heterogeneity was to be assessed using the standard Chi-square. Where statistical pooling was not possible the finding were be presented in narrative form. Results: There were no studies located that met the inclusion requirements of this review. There were also no text and opinion pieces that were specific to cognitive behavioral therapy techniques pain and lung cancer patients.Conclusions: There is currently no evidence available to determine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy techniques for pain in lung cancer patients.","Biofeedback; Cognitive/attentional distraction; Hypnosis; Imagery; Meditation; Mood; Relaxation","cognitive therapy; complication; human; lung tumor; outcome assessment; pain; procedures; Cognitive Therapy; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944185533

Efficiency of physical and/or mental training on the brain relies on the flexibility of networks' architecture molded by local remodeling of proteins and synapses of excitatory neurons producing transformations in network topology. Continuous remodeling of proteins of excitatory neurons is fine-tuning the scaling and strength of excitatory synapses up or down via regulation of intra-cellular metabolic and regulatory networks of the genome-transcriptome-proteome interface. Alzheimer's disease is a model of ""energy cost-driven small-world network disorder"" with dysfunction of high-energy cost wiring as the network global efficiency is impaired by the deposition of an informed agent, the amyloid-β, selectively targeting high-degree nodes. In schizophrenia, the interconnectivity and density of rich-club networks are significantly reduced. Training-induced homeostatic synaptogenesis-enhancement, presumably via reconfiguration of brain networks into greater small-worldness, appears essential in learning, memory, and executive functions. A macroscopic cartography of creation-removal of synaptic connections in a macro-network, and at the intra-cellular scale, micro-networks regulate the physiological mechanisms for the preferential attachment of synapses. The strongest molecular relationship of exercise and functional connectivity was identified for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The allele variant, rs7294919, also shows a powerful relationship with the hippocampal volume. How the brain achieves this unique quest of reconfiguration remains a puzzle. What are the underlying mechanisms of synaptogenesis promoting communications brain ↔ muscle and brain ↔ brain in such trainings? What is the respective role of independent mental, physical, or combined-mental-physical trainings? Physical practice seems to be playing an instrumental role in the cognitive enhancement (brain ↔ muscle com.). However, mental training, meditation or virtual reality (films, games) require only minimal motor activity and cardio-respiratory stimulation.

Neuroimaging studies have studied the effects of meditation on brain structure and function and findings have helped clarify the biological underpinnings of the positive effects of meditation practice and the possible integration of this technique in standard therapy. The large amount of data collected thus far allows drawing some conclusions about the neural effects of meditation practice. In the present study we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis to make a coordinate-based meta-Analysis of neuroimaging data on the effects of meditation on brain structure and function. Results indicate that meditation leads to activation in brain areas involved in processing self-relevant information, self-regulation, focused problem-solving, adaptive behavior, and interoception. Results also show that meditation practice induces functional and structural brain modifications in expert meditators, especially in areas involved in self-referential processes such as self-Awareness and self-regulation. These results demonstrate that a biological substrate underlies the positive pervasive effect of meditation practice and suggest that meditation techniques could be adopted in clinical populations and to prevent disease. © 2015 Maddalena Boccia et al.",,"adaptive behavior; Article; autoregulation; brain function; brain region; brain size; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; meditation; mental task; meta analysis; neuroimaging; problem solving; self concept; attention; brain; brain mapping; meditation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; Attention; Brain; Brain Mapping; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Meditation; Neuroimaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935022976

As the neural generators for most of the components are relatively well worked out, EPs have been used to understand the changes occurring during meditation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) yield useful information about the response to tasks, usually assessing attention. A brief review of the literature yielded eleven studies on EPs and seventeen on ERPs from 1978 to 2014. The EP studies covered short, mid, and long latency EPs, using both auditory and visual modalities. ERP studies reported the effects of meditation on tasks such as the auditory oddball paradigm, the attentional blink task, mismatched negativity, and affective picture viewing among others. Both EP and ERPs were recorded in several meditations detailed in the review. Maximum changes occurred in mid latency (auditory) EPs suggesting that maximum changes occur in the corresponding neural generators in the thalamus, thalamic radiations, and primary auditory cortical areas. ERP studies showed meditation can increase attention and enhance efficiency of brain resource allocation with greater emotional control. © 2015 Nilkamal Singh and Shirley Telles.",,"attention; attentional blink; brain stem; cognition; continuous performance test; event related potential; evoked auditory response; evoked response; evoked visual response; hearing; human; latent period; meditation; mindfulness; neuroimaging; primary auditory cortex; resource allocation; Review; thalamus; transcendental meditation; auditory evoked potential; electroencephalography; emotion; evoked response; meditation; physiology; psychology; visual evoked potential; Attention; Electroencephalography; Emotions; Evoked Potentials; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Humans; Meditation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84935002177

However, in the context of spiritual practice, these benefits are secondary gains, as the primary aim is spiritual transformation. Despite obvious difficulties in trying to measure a journey without goal, spiritual aspects involved in the practice of meditation should also be addressed by experimental study. This review starts by considering meditation in the form of the relaxation response (a counterpart to the stress response), before contrasting mindfulness research that emphasizes the role of attention and alertness in meditation. This contrast demonstrates how reference to traditional spiritual texts (in this case Buddhist) can be used to guide research questions involving meditation. Further considerations are detailed, along with the proposal that research should triangulate spiritual textual sources, first person accounts (i.e., neurophenomenology), and physiological/cognitive measures in order to aid our understanding of meditation, not only in the secular context of health benefits, but also in the context of spiritual practice. © 2015 Heather Buttle.",,"hydrocortisone; alertness; attention; brain size; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gray matter; human; meditation; mindfulness; physiology; religion; Review; sleep time; wakefulness; anxiety; brain; cognition; depression; meditation; mental stress; pathophysiology; psychology; Anxiety; Attention; Brain; Cognition; Depression; Humans; Meditation; Spirituality; Stress, Psychological",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934996353

After reviewing the mechanisms of mindfulness and its effects on clinical populations we will consider how the practice of mindfulness contributes to the regulation of emotions. We argue that mindfulness has achieved effective outcomes in the treatment of anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologies through the contribution of mindfulness to emotional regulation. We consider the unique factors that mindfulness meditation brings to the process of emotion regulation that may account for its effectiveness. We review experimental evidence that points towards the unique effects of mindfulness specifically operating over and above the regulatory effects of cognitive reappraisal mechanisms. A neuroanatomical circuit that leads to mindful emotion regulation is also suggested. This paper thereby aims to contribute to proposed models of mindfulness for research and theory building by proposing a specific model for the unique psychological and neural processes involved in mindful detachment that account for the effects of mindfulness over and above the effects accounted for by other well-established emotional regulation processes such as cognitive reappraisal. © 2015 Alessandro Grecucci et al.",,"acceptance and commitment therapy; anterior cingulate; anxiety disorder; behavior therapy; cingulate gyrus; cognition; comparative study; depression; electroencephalogram; emotionality; executive function; human; medial prefrontal cortex; meditation; mindfulness; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; psychoanalysis; Review; thinking; anxiety; cognition; emotion; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; Anxiety; Cognition; Depression; Emotions; Humans; Mindfulness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934961713

We aimed to demonstrate that: (a) individuals who display a larger cortisol response to an initial stressor exhibit progressive anticipatory sensitization, showing progressively higher cortisol levels before subsequent exposures, and (b) attention/emotional skills training can reduce the magnitude of this effect on progressive anticipatory sensitization. Female school teachers (N=. 76) were randomly assigned to attention/emotion skills and meditation training or to a control group. Participants completed 3 separate Trier Social Stress Tests (TSST): at baseline (Session 1), post-training (Session 2), and five months post (Session 3). Each TSST session included preparing and delivering a speech and performing an arithmetic task in front of critical evaluators. In each session participants' salivary cortisol levels were determined before and after the stressor. Control participants with larger cortisol reactivity to the first stressor showed increasing anticipatory (pre-stressor) cortisol levels with each successive stressor exposure (TSST session)-suggesting progressive anticipatory sensitization. Yet this association was absent in the training group. Supplementary analyses indicated that these findings occurred in the absence of group differences in cortisol reactivity. Findings suggest that the stress response can undergo progressive anticipatory sensitization, which may be modulated by attention/emotion-related processes. An important implication of the construct of progressive anticipatory sensitization is a possible self-perpetuating effect of stress reactions, providing a candidate mechanism for the translation of short-to-long-term stress reactions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Anticipation; Cortisol; Emotional training; HPA axis; Meditation; Sensitization; Stress","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; adult; anticipation; anxiety; Article; behavior therapy; controlled study; emotionality; female; habituation; hormone action; hormone response; human; meditation; randomized controlled trial; saliva level; self report; stress; stress assesment; anticipation; central nervous system sensitization; cognitive therapy; meditation; mental stress; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; procedures; therapy; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Central Nervous System Sensitization; Cognitive Therapy; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Meditation; Middle Aged; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922590598

Practice guidelines are needed to inform clinicians and patients about safe and effective therapies. Methods: Following the Institute of Medicine's guideline development process, a systematic review identified randomized controlled trials testing the use of integrative therapies for supportive care in patients receiving breast cancer treatment. Trials were included if the majority of participants had breast cancer and/or breast cancer patient results were reported separately, and outcomes were clinically relevant. Recommendations were organized by outcome and graded based upon a modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading system. Results: The search (January 1, 1990-December 31, 2013) identified 4900 articles, of which 203 were eligible for analysis. Meditation, yoga, and relaxation with imagery are recommended for routine use for common conditions, including anxiety and mood disorders (Grade A). Stress management, yoga, massage, music therapy, energy conservation, and meditation are recommended for stress reduction, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life (Grade B). Many interventions (n = 32) had weaker evidence of benefit (Grade C). Some interventions (n = 7) were deemed unlikely to provide any benefit (Grade D). Notably, only one intervention, acetyl-L-carnitine for the prevention of taxane-induced neuropathy, was identified as likely harmful (Grade H) as it was found to increase neuropathy. The majority of intervention/modality combinations (n = 138) did not have sufficient evidence to form specific recommendations (Grade I). Conclusions: Specific integrative therapies can be recommended as evidence-based supportive care options during breast cancer treatment. Most integrative therapies require further investigation via well-designed controlled trials with meaningful outcomes. © The Author 2014.",,"levacecarnine; antineoplastic agent; anxiety disorder; Article; breast cancer; cancer fatigue; cancer patient; depression; energy conservation; evidence based practice; human; imagery; integrative medicine; leisure; massage; meditation; mood disorder; music therapy; neuropathy; practice guideline; preventive health service; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); stress management; systematic review; treatment outcome; yoga; alternative medicine; analgesia; anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; chemically induced; complication; fatigue; female; integrative medicine; lymphedema; mental stress; nausea; practice guideline; psychology; standards; vomiting; Antineoplastic Agents; Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Depression; Fatigue; Female; Humans; Integrative Medicine; Lymphedema; Nausea; Pain Management; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Vomiting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936938231

Accordingly, the current study explored the possibility that mindfulness-based meditation may improve people's mindreading skills. Following a 5-minute mindfulness induction, participants with no prior meditation experience completed tests that assessed mindreading and empathic understanding. The results revealed that brief mindfulness meditation enhanced both mental state attribution and empathic concern, compared to participants in the control group.

With the advent of systems biology, attention shifted from the association between UPE and reactive oxygen species towards UPE as a reflection of changed metabolic networks. Essential for this shift in thinking is the development of novel photon count statistical methods that more reflect the dynamics of the systems organization. Additionally, efforts to combine and correlate UPE data with other types of measurements such as metabolomics be key to understand the complexity of the human body. This review describes the history and developments in the area of human UPE research from a technical - methodological perspective, an experimental perspective and a theoretical perspective. There is ample evidence that human UPE research will allow a better understanding of the body as a complex dynamical system. The future lies in the further development of an integrated UPE and metabolomics platform for a personalized monitoring of changes of the system towards health or disease. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the underlying physiological and neurological processes that take place during stress and meditation techniques may be critical for effectively treating stress-related diseases. The article examines a hypothetical physiological homeostatic response that compares and contrasts changes in central and peripheral oscillations during stress and meditation, and relates these to changes in the autonomic system and neurological activity. The authors discuss how cardiorespiratory synchronization, which occurs during the parasympathetic response and meditation, influences and modulates activity and oscillations of the brain and autonomic nervous system.

Various studies highlight cognitive impairments in cancer patients. This paper proposes a review of longitudinal controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to reduce these cognitive impairments. Method. Longitudinal controlled studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions aiming to reduce cognitive impairments in adult cancer patients and published between 1993 and 2013 were identified, with the exception of studies that implied patients suffering from CNS tumor or metastasis. Results. Pharmacological interventions (n = 11) suggested the positive impact of modafinil on memory and executive functions. Non-pharmacological interventions (n = 10) suggested the positive impact of cognitive revalidation and stimulation programs, psycho-education and meditation on several memory, attentional and executive objective as well as subjective functions. Nonpharmacological interventions show more significant cognitive benefits than pharmacological interventions. Conclusion. Some longitudinal controlled studies support the usefulness of interventions aiming to reduce cognitive impairments in cancer patients. Further studies should evaluate the effectiveness of programs combining technics aiming to reduce cognitive impairments and psychotherapeutic technics aiming to support patients' coping with illness. ©John Libbey Eurotext","Cancer; Cognitive impairments; Pharmacological interventions; Revalidation","modafinil; benzhydryl derivative; central stimulant agent; donepezil; erythropoietin; estradiol; indan derivative; methylphenidate; modafinil; novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein; piperidine derivative; Article; cancer patient; cognitive defect; executive function; human; longitudinal study; meditation; memory; oncology; psychoeducation; adult; analogs and derivatives; case control study; cognition; Cognition Disorders; female; male; meditation; Neoplasms; Adult; Benzhydryl Compounds; Case-Control Studies; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Cognition; Cognition Disorders; Erythropoietin; Estradiol; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Indans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Meditation; Methylphenidate; Neoplasms; Piperidines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908680954

Later research attempted to categorize meditation as either involving focused or distributed attentional systems. Neither of these hypotheses received strong empirical support, and most of the studies investigated Theravada style meditative practices. In this study, we compared neurophysiological (EEG, EKG) and cognitive correlates of meditative practices that are thought to utilize either focused or distributed attention, from both Theravada and Vajrayana traditions. The results of Study 1 show that both focused (Shamatha) and distributed (Vipassana) attention meditations of the Theravada tradition produced enhanced parasympathetic activation indicative of a relaxation response. In contrast, both focused (Deity) and distributed (Rig-pa) meditations of the Vajrayana tradition produced sympathetic activation, indicative of arousal. Additionally, the results of Study 2 demonstrated an immediate dramatic increase in performance on cognitive tasks following only Vajrayana styles of meditation, indicating enhanced phasic alertness due to arousal. Furthermore, our EEG results showed qualitatively different patterns of activation between Theravada and Vajrayana meditations, albeit highly similar activity between meditations within the same tradition. In conclusion, consistent with Tibetan scriptures that described Shamatha and Vipassana techniques as those that calm and relax the mind, and Vajrayana techniques as those that require 'an awake quality' of the mind, we show that Theravada and Vajrayana meditations are based on different neurophysiological mechanisms, which give rise to either a relaxation or arousal response. Hence, it may be more appropriate to categorize meditations in terms of relaxation vs. arousal, whereas classification methods that rely on the focused vs. distributed attention dichotomy may need to be reexamined. © 2014 Amihai, Kozhevnikov.",,"adult; alertness; alpha rhythm; arousal; article; beta rhythm; cognition; comparative study; delta rhythm; electrocardiogram; electroencephalogram; female; gamma rhythm; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; leisure; male; meditation; mental task; neurophysiology; parasympathetic function; spectroscopy; task performance; Theravada meditation; theta rhythm; Vajrayana meditation; arousal; attention; Buddhism; cholinergic system; cognition; electrocardiography; electroencephalography; heart rate; leisure; meditation; memory; middle aged; neurophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; Adult; Arousal; Attention; Brain Waves; Buddhism; Cognition; Electrocardiography; Electroencephalography; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Meditation; Memory; Middle Aged; Neurophysiology; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Relaxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904694412

In order to assess whether the combination of repetitive drumming and shamanic instructions is specifically associated with these effects, we compared the effect of listening to either repetitive drumming or instrumental meditation music for 15 minutes on salivary cortisol concentration and on self-reported physiological and psychological states. For each musical style, two groups of participants were exposed to two conditions: instructions for shamanic journeying or relaxation instructions. A total of 39 participants (24 females) inexperienced in shamanic journeying completed the experiment. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured before and after exposure to music. In addition, participants filled out a mood questionnaire before and after the experiment and completed a post experiment questionnaire on their experiences. A significant decrease in the concentration in salivary cortisol was observed across all musical styles and instructions, indicating that exposure to 15 minutes of either repetitive drumming or instrumental meditation music, while lying down, was sufficient to induce a decrease in cortisol levels. However, no differences were observed across conditions. Significant differences in reported emotional states and subjective experiences were observed between the groups. Notably, participants exposed to repetitive drumming combined with shamanic instructions reported experiencing heaviness, decreased heart rate, and dreamlike experiences significantly more often than participants exposed to repetitive drumming combined with relaxation instructions. Our findings suggest that the subjective effects specifically attributed to repetitive drumming and shamanic journeying may not be reflected in differential endocrine responses. © 2014 Gingras et al.",,"hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; adult; age distribution; aged; article; auditory stimulation; controlled study; drumming; female; hearing; heart rate; hormone response; human; human experiment; hydrocortisone saliva level; leisure; male; meditation; mood; music; normal human; psychological rating scale; questionnaire; saliva level; scoring system; stimulus response; very elderly; alternative medicine; anxiety; chemistry; emotion; mental stress; middle aged; music therapy; physiology; pilot study; procedures; saliva; therapy; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Emotions; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Therapies; Music Therapy; Pilot Projects; Relaxation; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904300274

In addition, the mechanisms underlying the potential blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of MM are unknown. We sought to determine whether MM acutely lowers BP in CKD patients, and whether these hemodynamic changes are mediated by a reduction in sympathetic nerve activity. In 15 hypertensive African-American (AA) males with CKD, we conducted a randomized, crossover study in which participants underwent 14 min of MM or 14 min of BP education (control intervention) during two separate random-order study visits. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), beat-to-beat arterial BP, heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR) were continuously measured at baseline and during each intervention. A subset had a third study visit to undergo controlled breathing (CB) to determine whether a reduction in RR alone was sufficient in exacting hemodynamic changes. We observed a significantly greater reduction in systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, and HR, as well as a significantly greater reduction in MSNA, during MM compared with the control intervention. Participants had a significantly lower RR during MM; however, in contrast to MM, CB alone did not reduce BP, HR, or MSNA. MM acutely lowers BP and HR in AA males with hypertensive CKD, and these hemodynamic effects may be mediated by a reduction in sympathetic nerve activity. RR is significantly lower during MM, but CB alone without concomitant meditation does not acutely alter hemodynamics or sympathetic activity in CKD. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.","Chronic renal insufficiency; Mindfulness meditation; Muscle sympathetic nerve activity","angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dihydropyridine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; adult; African American; aged; article; blood pressure; body mass; breathing; breathing rate; chronic kidney disease; clinical article; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; follow up; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; male; mean arterial pressure; meditation; mindfulness; mindfulness meditation; muscle sympathetic nerve activity; priority journal; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; sympathetic nerve; sympathetic tone; systolic blood pressure; chronic renal insufficiency; mindfulness meditation; muscle sympathetic nerve activity; African Americans; Aged; Blood Pressure; Cross-Over Studies; Georgia; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Muscle, Skeletal; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Respiratory Rate; Sympathetic Nervous System; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903602938

Evidence is convincing that emotional distress, depression, anxiety, uncertainty, and hopelessness interact with pain. Unrelieved pain can increase a desire for hastened death. Patients with cancer use many strategies to manage pain, with catastrophizing associated with increased pain and self-efficacy associated with lower pain reports. A variety of psychological and cognitive behavioral treatments can reduce pain severity and interference with function, as indicated in multiple meta-analyses and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Effective methods include education (with coping skills training), hypnosis, cognitive behavioral approaches, and relaxation with imagery. Exercise has been tested extensively in patients with cancer and long-term survivors, but few exercise studies have evaluated pain outcomes. In survivors post-treatment, yoga and hypnosis as well as exercise show promise for controlling pain. Although some of these treatments effectively reduce pain for patients with advanced disease, few have been tested in patients at the end of life. Given the clear indicators that psychological factors affect cancer pain and that psychological and behavioral treatments are effective in reducing varying types of pain for patients with active disease, these methods need further testing in cancer survivors post-treatment and in patients with end-stage disease.

This article has two major objectives: first, to sketch a basic science of intentional change centered on evolution; second, to provide examples of intentional behavioral and cultural change from the applied behavioral sciences, which are largely unknown to the basic scientific community. All species have evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity that enable them to respond adaptively to their environments. Some mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity count as evolutionary processes in their own right. The human capacity for symbolic thought provides an inheritance system with the same kind of combinatorial diversity as genetic recombination and antibody formation. Taking these propositions seriously allows an integration of major traditions within the basic behavioral sciences, such as behaviorism, social constructivism, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology, which are often isolated and even conceptualized as opposed to each other. The applied behavioral sciences include well-validated examples of successfully managing behavioral and cultural change at scales ranging from individuals, to small groups, to large populations. However, these examples are largely unknown beyond their disciplinary boundaries, for lack of a unifying theoretical framework. Viewed from an evolutionary perspective, they are examples of managing evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, including open-ended processes of variation and selection. Once the many branches of the basic and applied behavioral sciences become conceptually unified, we are closer to a science of intentional change than one might think.

However, the cognitive, affective and motivational features of depression and anxiety might render MBIs ineffective for people experiencing current symptoms. This paper presents a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of MBIs where participants met diagnostic criteria for a current episode of an anxiety or depressive disorder. Method: Post-intervention between-group Hedges g effect sizes were calculated using a random effects model. Moderator analyses of primary diagnosis, intervention type and control condition were conducted and publication bias was assessed. Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria (n = 578). There were significant post-intervention between-group benefits of MBIs relative to control conditions on primary symptom severity (Hedges g = -0.59, 95% CI = -0.12 to -1.06). Effects were demonstrated for depressive symptom severity (Hedges g = -0.73, 95% CI = -0.09 to -1.36), but not for anxiety symptom severity (Hedges g = -0.55, 95% CI = 0.09 to -1.18), for RCTs with an inactive control (Hedges g = -1.03, 95% CI = -0.40 to -1.66), but not where there was an active control (Hedges g = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.54 to -0.48) and effects were found for MBCT (Hedges g = -0.39, 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.63) but not for MBSR (Hedges g = -0.75, 95% CI = 0.31 to -1.81). Conclusions: This is the first meta-analysis of RCTs of MBIs where all studies included only participants who were diagnosed with a current episode of a depressive or anxiety disorder. Effects of MBIs on primary symptom severity were found for people with a current depressive disorder and it is recommended that MBIs might be considered as an intervention for this population. © 2014 Strauss et al.",,"anxiety disorder; article; clinical effectiveness; depression; disease severity; human; intermethod comparison; meta analysis; mindfulness based cognitive therapy; mindfulness based stress reduction; person based cognitive therapy; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment outcome; treatment response; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder; meditation; mindfulness; psychology; recurrent disease; Anxiety Disorders; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Meditation; Mindfulness; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899721936

These techniques are relatively simple exercises that allow happiness seekers to mimic thoughts and behavior of naturally happy people, in order to increase their level of well-being. Because research has shown that the joint use of these exercises increases their effects, practitioners who want to help happiness seekers need validated interventions that combine several of these techniques. To meet this need, we have developed and tested an integrative intervention (Positive Emotion Regulation program - PER program) incorporating a number of validated techniques structured around a theoretical model: the Process Model of Positive Emotion Regulation. To test the effectiveness of this program and to identify its added value relative to existing interventions, 113 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a 6-week positive emotion regulation pilot program, a loving-kindness meditation training program, or a wait-list control group. Results indicate that fewer participants dropped out from the PER program than from the Loving-Kindness Meditation training. Furthermore, subjects in the PER group showed a significant increase in subjective well-being and life satisfaction and a significant decrease in depression and physical symptoms when compared to controls.

In this study, we use a modified multilayered neural network to numerically examine the trade-off between incremental learning and generalization abilities, and then we propose a novel network model with structural lateral inhibitions to reconcile the two abilities. We also analyze the behavior of the proposed model using Formal Concept Analysis, which reveals that the network implements ""conceptualization"": differentiation and meditation between intensional and extensional representations. This study suggests a new paradigm for the traditional question, whether representations in the brain are distributed or not. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Catastrophic interference; Distributed representation; Formal Concept Analysis; Generalization; Incremental learning; Lateral inhibition","artificial neural network; catastrophic event; conceptual framework; inhibition; numerical model; paradigm shift; trade-environment relations; article; concept analysis; incremental learning; inhibition (psychology); learning; learning algorithm; learning curve; meditation; memory; multilayered neural network; nerve cell network; receptive field; algorithm; artificial neural network; biological model; brain; computer simulation; concept formation; human; learning; physiology; Algorithms; Brain; Computer Simulation; Concept Formation; Humans; Learning; Models, Neurological; Neural Networks (Computer)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896878979

Sparrow and Wegner showed that this tendency was eliminated if participants answered questions correctly before answering randomly. They argued that answering a question correctly unprimes the tendency to choose the correct answer, thereby reducing the correct response rate close to the chance level of.5. An alternative explanation, consistent with these results, is that answering questions correctly provides a baseline, which allows participants to strategize, i.e., to match and mismatch equal numbers of their purportedly random responses to the baseline response. Three studies showed that the presence of a baseline, even when unpriming is not feasible, led to lower correct response rates than those obtained in a condition in which no baseline was available. Furthermore, the presence of a baseline led to more nonrandom sequences of correct and incorrect responses. One specific sequence-alternating correct and incorrect answers-mediated the relation between the presence of a baseline and lower correct response rate. These findings suggest that strategizing, not unpriming, accounts for Sparrow and Wegner's results. © 2014 Zuckerman et al.",,"article; decision making; female; human; male; meditation; motivation; randomization; response variable; strategizing; thinking; unpriming; Decision Making; Female; Goals; Humans; Male; Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895522092

However, the mechanisms responsible for such clinically relevant effects remain elusive. Methods: Here we explored the impact of a day of intensive practice of mindfulness meditation in experienced subjects (n=19) on the expression of circadian, chromatin modulatory and inflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In parallel, we analyzed a control group of subjects with no meditation experience who engaged in leisure activities in the same environment (n=21). PBMC from all participants were obtained before (t1) and after (t2) the intervention (t2-t1=8h) and gene expression was analyzed using custom pathway focused quantitative-real time PCR assays. Both groups were also presented with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Results: Core clock gene expression at baseline (t1) was similar between groups and their rhythmicity was not influenced in meditators by the intensive day of practice. Similarly, we found that all the epigenetic regulatory enzymes and inflammatory genes analyzed exhibited similar basal expression levels in the two groups. In contrast, after the brief intervention we detected reduced expression of histone deacetylase genes (HDAC 2, 3 and 9), alterations in global modification of histones (H4ac; H3K4me3) and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes (RIPK2 and COX2) in meditators compared with controls. We found that the expression of RIPK2 and HDAC2 genes was associated with a faster cortisol recovery to the TSST in both groups. Conclusions: The regulation of HDACs and inflammatory pathways may represent some of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of mindfulness-based interventions. Our findings set the foundation for future studies to further assess meditation strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Epigenetics; HDAC; Inflammation; Meditation; Mindfulness; Stress","cyclooxygenase 2; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase 2; histone deacetylase 3; histone H3; histone H4; hydrocortisone; article; circadian rhythm; controlled study; cox2 gene; epigenetics; gene; gene expression; Hdac2 gene; HDAC3 gene; HDAC9 gene; histone modification; human; human cell; inflammation; meditation; mental stress; mindfulness; priority journal; psychologic test; RIPK2 gene; Trier Social Stress Test; Epigenetics; HDAC; Inflammation; Meditation; Mindfulness; Stress; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Male; Meditation; Mindfulness; Recovery of Function; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893419287

Heart rate variability is an indicator of the dynamic interaction and balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic system. The HRV can be measured non-invasively. Therefore it becomes an attractive measure to use in the study of the ANS to response to different stimuli. Sahaja yoga meditation creates a thoughtless awareness by virtue of which a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is achieved. Aims & Objective: To evaluate and compare the HRV parameters in healthy subjects above 40 years before and after practice of Sahaja yoga meditation and to correlate HRV parameters with age. Materials and Methods: The study included 30 healthy normal subjects above 40 years of age, willing for Sahaja yoga meditation, selected from JNMC campus as well as Wardha district. The study group was between 40-70 years of age. The time and frequency domain parameters of HRV were evaluated in all 30 subjects using RMS polyrite machine. The subjects were trained to practice sahaja yoga meditation. After 3 months of meditation practice, they were again evaluated for HRV parameters. The results were analyzed using unpaired student test & Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: The mean heart rate of the subjects decreased significantly from 72.59 ± 10.5 to 68.30 ± 7.5 (p value <0.05) after 3 months of meditation Increase in the HF was highly significant from the mean 99.39 ± 178.2 to 116 30 ± 147.52 p value < 0.01 after meditation practice. The LF/HF ratio decreased significantly after meditation. The time domain parameters i.e. SDNN and pNN50% were found to be significantly high (p value < 0.01) after 3 months of meditation Age was negatively correlated with the pre LF and pre HF which was not significant. Conclusion: The present study signifies the role of Sahaja yoga meditation in the modification of age associated decline in the HRV in healthy subjects above 40 years. Therefore this study recommends daily practice of Sahaja yoga meditation for prevention of risk of cardiac autonomic dysfunction with increasing age.","Ageing; Heart Rate Variability (HRV); Sahaja Yoga Meditation","adult; age; aged; article; electrophysiology; heart rate; heart rate variability; Holter monitoring; human; human experiment; longitudinal study; normal human; prospective study; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950173290

It is non-sectarian and scientific technique of self-observation and truth-realization which leads to progressive better insight and positive mental health attributes, as also, inculcation of universal human values like love and goodwill, tolerance and compassion, peace and harmony, and spirituality. It's practical applications are discussed in this article. The main goal of this research was to study the effects of Vipassana on psychological well-being of people. In present research, two 200-person groups (experimental and control) were recruited. The experimental group included the participants of the 10-Day Vipassana courses. Before training, both groups were pretested then the experimental group was influenced by independent variable (Vipassana course). After the course finished both groups were tested again. Also, 3 months after training and applying this technique in daily life and interpersonal communication in experimental group, in order to pursue any expected changes, both groups have been tested for the third time. For statistical analysis of the results, the method of Mancova was used. The results showed that the experimental group after getting trained and practicing the technique regularly through their lives had obvious significant changes in 6 dimensions of autonomy, purposefulness in life, personal growth, environmental mastery, positive relationships with others and self-acceptance. So training and the regular applying of Vipassana technique had significant effect on increasing the level of psychological well-Being of our sample.","Meditation; Psychological well-being; Self-observation; Vipassana","adult; aged; Article; breathing mechanics; controlled study; daily life activity; electroencephalogram; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; meditation; nervous system parameters; patient attitude; psychological well being; quasi experimental study; reality therapy; therapy effect; vipassana meditation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922683183

Methods: Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 52 key Chinese informants using a semi-structured questionnaire. Quantitative ethnobotanical indices, namely, the informant consensus factor (FIC), the use value, the fidelity level, the index of agreement on remedies and the relative importance were calculated. Results: Plants (61) and animal species (17), belonging to 43 and 9 families respectively, constituted the exploited flora and fauna by the Chinese community. Based on the FIC the main categories of plants used were employed against injury and poisons due to external causes (FIC=0.97), diseases of the respiratory system (FIC=0.96), diseases of the eye and adnexa (FIC=0.95), undefined pains or illness (FIC=0.95), diseases during the postpartum period, diseases of the digestive system and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (FIC=0.94 each). For zootherapy, diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the eye and adnexa, diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue and endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases had total consensus (FIC=1.00). Conclusions: It was found that the Chinese community of Mauritius still relies, to a great extent, on NRs which need to be preserved and used sustainably.

However, a close examination of the methodologies indicates that, from a standpoint of basic science, the vast majority of 'integrative' treatments are supported by little, if any, scientific evidence.

Psychological distress and the CAR are not consistently related, however. Individual differences in aspects of dispositional mindfulness which reflect how people relate to negative thoughts and emotions may help explain such inconsistencies. We tested whether the tendency to (1) label and describe inner experiences and (2) accept negative thoughts and feelings without judgment moderated the association between psychological distress and the CAR. Methods: Self-reported dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, anxiety, negative affect, rumination, and the CAR were assessed among overweight/obese women. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether dispositional mindfulness moderated the relationship between indicators of psychological distress and the CAR. Results: While psychological distress was consistently positively related to the CAR, these associations were qualified by significant interactions with both components of dispositional mindfulness. Psychological distress was associated with the CAR at lower levels of dispositional mindfulness but not at higher levels. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with the idea that the tendency to describe and accept experiences may buffer the impact of psychological distress on physiological arousal. These metacognitive processes may be important moderators in unraveling the complex relationship between psychological distress and physiological stress reactivity. Further research is recommended to replicate this approach in other populations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Acceptance; Cortisol; Cortisol awakening response; Dispositional mindfulness; Meditation; Negative affect; Perceived stress; Rumination","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; affect; anxiety; arousal; article; clinical article; Cortisol awakening response; dispositional mindfulness; distress syndrome; female; human; metabolism; mindfulness; obesity; physiological stress; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); rumination; self report; adaptive behavior; chemistry; controlled study; mental stress; perception; personality; physiology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; saliva; thinking; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Arousal; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Mindfulness; Perception; Personality; Questionnaires; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Thinking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904895674

The objective of our study was to gather information on patients' usage of CAM, source of information, and aims, in order to derive strategies to improve the communication between physicians and patients on this topic. Materials and Methods: An online survey was conducted by linking a standardized questionnaire to the largest internet portal for cancer patients in Germany. The questionnaire addresses CAM usage, disclosure to physicians, source of information, objectives for using CAM, and perceived reasons for cancer. Results: Of 170 participants, 77% were currently using CAM. Disclosure to a physician was rather high with 63% having informed their oncologist. Asked whether the oncologist took time to discuss CAM, 74% answered 'no'. Most frequently used are biologically based therapies, relaxation techniques, prayer, and meditation. Most patients want to reduce side effects, boost their immune system, and get active. Almost half the participants had positive experiences with some type of CAM before they fell ill. Conclusion: Understanding patients' concepts of the etiology of cancer and accepting their goals for using CAM may help oncologists communicate with their patients and guide them to a safe use of CAM. © 2014 S.

To examine TCC-associated changes in functional connectomes, resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were acquired from 40 older individuals including 22 experienced TCC practitioners (experts) and 18 demographically matched TCC-naïve healthy controls, and their local functional homogeneities across the cortical mantle were compared. Compared to the controls, the TCC experts had significantly greater and more experience-dependent functional homogeneity in the right post-central gyrus (PosCG) and less functional homogeneity in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. Increased functional homogeneity in the PosCG was correlated with TCC experience. Intriguingly, decreases in functional homogeneity (improved functional specialization) in the left ACC and increases in functional homogeneity (improved functional integration) in the right PosCG both predicted performance gains on attention network behavior tests. These findings provide evidence for the functional plasticity of the brain's intrinsic architecture toward optimizing locally functional organization, with great implications for understanding the effects of TCC on cognition, behavior and health in aging population. © 014 Wei, Dong, Yang, Luo and Zuo.","Aerobic exercise; Executive function; Functional homogeneity; Meditation; Tai Chi Chuan","adult; anterior cingulate; article; attention; behavior; brain cortex; cognition; connectome; controlled study; executive function; experience; female; frontal cortex; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; major clinical study; male; nerve cell plasticity; neuroanatomy; postcentral gyrus; posterior cingulate; prefrontal cortex; resting state network; Tai Chi; task performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901353462

Here we extended this research by investigating the relation between age and fluid intelligence and resting state brain functional network architecture using graph theory, in middle-aged yoga and meditation practitioners, and matched controls. Fluid intelligence declined slower in yoga practitioners and meditators combined than in controls. Resting state functional networks of yoga practitioners and meditators combined were more integrated and more resilient to damage than those of controls. Furthermore, mindfulness was positively correlated with fluid intelligence, resilience, and global network efficiency.

Fatigued survivors show evidence of elevated inflammation, but the physiological mechanisms driving inflammatory activity have not been determined. Alterations in the autonomic nervous system, and particularly parasympathetic nervous system activity, are a plausible, yet understudied contributor to cancer-related fatigue. The goal of this study was to replicate one previous study showing an association between lower parasympathetic activity and higher fatigue in breast cancer survivors (Fagundes et al., 2011), and to examine whether inflammation mediates this association. Study participants were drawn from two samples and included 84 women originally diagnosed with early stage breast cancer prior to age 50. Participants completed questionnaires, provided blood samples for determination of interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), and underwent electrocardiography (ECG) assessment for evaluation of resting heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of parasympathetic activity. Results showed that lower HRV was associated with higher fatigue (p< .05), as predicted. In bivariate analyses, HRV was also correlated with circulating concentrations of IL-6 and CRP. However, path analyses did not support inflammation as a mediator of the association between HRV and fatigue; instead, associations among these variables appeared to be driven by age and BMI. These findings identify HRV as a potential contributor to cancer-related fatigue, but suggest that inflammation does not mediate this association in younger, healthy breast cancer survivors who are several years post-treatment. The autonomic nervous system merits additional attention in research on the etiology of cancer-related fatigue. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Autonomic functioning; Autonomic nervous system; Inflammation; Parasympathetic activity; Symptoms","C reactive protein; interleukin 6; autacoid; adult; age; article; body mass; breast cancer; cancer fatigue; cancer survivor; concentration response; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease association; early cancer; electrocardiography; female; heart rate variability; human; inflammation; major clinical study; parasympathetic tone; physical activity; prediction; priority journal; protein blood level; questionnaire; aged; blood; Breast Neoplasms; complication; fatigue; heart rate; meditation; middle aged; mindfulness; motor activity; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; randomized controlled trial; statistics and numerical data; survivor; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Fatigue; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Motor Activity; Survivors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901242790

When subjects tried to increase their heart rate by volition, the parasympathetic nervous system was inhibited and the sympathetic nervous system was stimulated, and the heart rate increased. When autonomic nervous system activity was regulated by mental tasks, the information flow from the post-central areas to the pre-central areas of the cerebral cortex increased, and there was greater coupling between the brain and the heart. Use of directed transfer function and corrected conditional entropy techniques enabled analysis of electroencephalographic recordings, and of the information flow causing functional coupling between the brain and the heart. © 2014 The Author(s).","autonomic nervous system; cerebral cortex; heart rate variability; information flow; mental task","adult; algorithm; analysis of variance; anxiety; autonomic nervous system; brain cortex; cognition; electroencephalography; heart rate; human; male; meditation; mental stress; pathophysiology; physiology; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Analysis of Variance; Anxiety; Autonomic Nervous System; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Meditation; Stress, Psychological; Volition; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900866184

A second objective evaluates whether pre-existing levels of dispositional mindfulness moderate the effects of brief mindfulness meditation training on stress reactivity. Methods: Sixty-six (N=66) participants were randomly assigned to either a brief 3-day (25-min per day) mindfulness meditation training or an analytic cognitive training control program. All participants completed a standardized laboratory social-evaluative stress challenge task (the TSST) following the third mindfulness meditation or cognitive training session. Measures of psychological (stress perceptions) and biological (salivary cortisol, blood pressure) stress reactivity were collected during the social evaluative stress-challenge session. Results: Brief mindfulness meditation training reduced self-reported psychological stress reactivity but increased salivary cortisol reactivity to the TSST, relative to the cognitive training comparison program. Participants who were low in pre-existing levels of dispositional mindfulness and then received mindfulness meditation training had the greatest cortisol reactivity to the TSST. No significant main or interactive effects were observed for systolic or diastolic blood pressure reactivity to the TSST. Conclusions: The present study provides an initial indication that brief mindfulness meditation training buffers self-reported psychological stress reactivity, but also increases cortisol reactivity to social evaluative stress. This pattern may indicate that initially brief mindfulness meditation training fosters greater active coping efforts, resulting in reduced psychological stress appraisals and greater cortisol reactivity during social evaluative stressors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Meditation; Mindfulness; Stress; Trier social stress test","hydrocortisone; hydrocortisone; adult; article; cardiovascular function; cognitive therapy; controlled study; coping behavior; diastolic blood pressure; dispositional mindfulness; female; hormone response; human; human experiment; male; meditation; mental stress; mindfulness; neuroendocrine system; normal human; priority journal; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; saliva level; self report; social stress; standardization; systolic blood pressure; task performance; therapy effect; Trier Social Stress Test; adaptive behavior; adolescent; anxiety; chemistry; heart rate; human relation; meditation; mindfulness; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; saliva; treatment outcome; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Meditation; Mindfulness; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899555446

This research project is concerned with how designers can draw inspiration from nature and how nature can affect and help develop creativity and make conceptual design decisions. In particular, the premise of this research project developed from experience and understanding of teaching undergraduate interior design students. The researcher wanted to explore new and innovative approaches to develop and share creativity. The research methods used involved an independent measures design consisting of thirty, year one, undergraduate interior design students. This group of students was presented with a lecture on the specific topic of inspiration transmitted through the study of nature. Subsequently, all students who attended the lecture were then asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their understanding of the importance of this area of study and whether learning more about this topic would help their own creativity and design decisions. The findings revealed that the majority of students found that this lecture fascinated them; helped to broaden their thinking and impacted their creative design and processes. The students also stated their desire to see this topic included on the undergraduate specification as a core module of teaching. Practical recommendations from this research include the need to establish and impart a core teaching module that focuses on inspiration transmitted through nature; as the findings revealed that students were interested in this topic as an aid to the development of their designs. Furthermore, it is clear that the study of nature can be a source of inspiration for the whole generation and perhaps it should even be introduced into the curriculum at an earlier age possibly during elementary school. A meditation and awareness of nature can be a source of perpetual creative inspiration, which can benefit society as a whole. It is hoped that this approach could be widely applied in classroom practice and stimulate improvements in pedagogical practices.","Biomimicry; Creativity; Interior design; Visual inspiration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899148017

This particular quality of awareness has been associated to several indicators of physical and psychological health, and can be developed using mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), and therefore MBIs have been successfully applied as preventive and complementary interventions and therapies in medicine and psychology. Together with quiet sitting and lying meditation practices, mindful physical exercises such as ""mindful walking"" and ""mindful movement"" are key elements in MBIs and couple muscular activity with an internally directed focus, improving interoceptive attention to bodily sensations. In addition, MBIs seem to share similar mechanisms with physical fitness (PF) by which they may influence cardiovascular responses to stress. Based on these facts, it is feasible to raise the question of whether physical training itself may induce the development of that particular quality of awareness associated with mindfulness, or if one's dispositional mindfulness (DM) (the tendency to be more mindful in daily life) could moderate the effects of exercise on cardiovascular response to stress. The role of mindfulness as a mediator or moderator of the effect of exercise training on cardiovascular responses to stress has barely been studied. In this study, we have hypothesized pathways (moderation and mediation) by which mindfulness could significantly influence the effects of PF on cardiovascular responses to stress and discussed potential practical ways to test these hypotheses. © 2014 Demarzo, Montero-Marin, Stein, Cebolla, Provinciale and García-Campayo.","Cardiovascular system; Mediational model; Mindful exercise; Mindfulness; Moderator effects; Physical fitness; Psychological stress","antidepressant agent; aerobic exercise; article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular response; chronic stress; depression; dispositional mindfulness; fitness; heart rate variability; human; meditation; mental stress; mindfulness; oxidative stress; parasympathetic tone; physical stress; resistance training; respiratory tract infection; stress management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897931221

Self-compassion training also led to greater self-compassion under threat relative to the control groups. In that social stress pervades modern life, self-compassion represents a promising approach to diminishing its potentially negative psychological and biological effects. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Alpha-amylase; Cortisol; Heart rate variability; Self-compassion; Social threat; Stress","amylase; hydrocortisone; adult; anxiety; article; controlled study; enzyme analysis; female; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; parasympathetic tone; priority journal; psychobiology; saliva analysis; saliva level; self compassion; self esteem; sinus arrhythmia; social behavior; social stress; threat; training; Alpha-amylase; Cortisol; Heart rate variability; Self-compassion; Social threat; Stress; Adolescent; Anxiety; Attention; Empathy; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Meditation; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Saliva; Salivary alpha-Amylases; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895860150

Included is theory of how maladaptive mental processes become habitual and automatic, both from the Buddhist and Western psychological perspective. Specific noting and labeling techniques in open monitoring meditation, described in the Theravada and Western contemporary traditions, are highlighted as providing unique access to multiple modalities of awareness. Potential explicit and implicit mechanisms are discussed by which such techniques can contribute to transforming maladaptive habits of mind and perceptual and cognitive biases, improving efficiency, facilitating integration, and providing the flexibility to switch between systems of self-processing. Finally, a model is provided to describe the timing by which noting and labeling practices have the potential to influence different stages of low- and high-level neural processing. Hypotheses are proposed concerning both levels of processing in relation to the extent of practice.

This review focuses explicitly on experimental pain studies of meditation and attempts to draw preliminary conclusions based on the work completed in this new field over the past 6 years. Dividing meditative practices into the broad categories of focused attention (FA) and open monitoring (OM) techniques allowed several patterns to emerge. The majority of evidence for FA practices suggests they are not particularly effective in reducing pain. OM, on the other hand, seems to influence both sensory and affective pain ratings depending on the tradition or on whether the practitioners were meditating. The neural pattern underlying pain modulation during OM suggests meditators actively focus on the noxious stimulation while inhibiting other mental processes, consistent with descriptions of mindfulness. A preliminary model is presented for explaining the influence of mindfulness practice on pain.

This article suggests an unusual path for future advancement: complementing conventional research with rigorous dialogue with the contemplative traditions that train expert meditators and best know the techniques. It explores the Nalanda tradition developed in India and preserved in Tibet, because its cumulative approach to contemplative methods produced a comprehensive framework that may help interpret data and guide research, and because its naturalistic theories and empirical methods may help bridge the gulf between science and other contemplative traditions. Examining recent findings and models in light of this framework, the article introduces the Indic map of the central nervous system and presents three testable predictions based on it.

Traditional Buddhist formulations describe meditation as a state of relaxed alertness that must guard against both excessive hyperarousal (restlessness) and excessive hypoarousal (drowsiness, sleep). Modern applications of meditation have emphasized the hypoarousing and relaxing effects without as much emphasis on the arousing or alertness-promoting effects. In an attempt to counterbalance the plethora of data demonstrating the relaxing and hypoarousing effects of Buddhist meditation, this interdisciplinary review aims to provide evidence of meditation's arousing or wake-promoting effects by drawing both from Buddhist textual sources and from scientific studies, including subjective, behavioral, and neuroimaging studies during wakefulness, meditation, and sleep. Factors that may influence whether meditation increases or decreases arousal are discussed, with particular emphasis on dose, expertise, and contemplative trajectory. The course of meditative progress suggests a nonlinear multiphasic trajectory, such that early phases that are more effortful may produce more fatigue and sleep propensity, while later stages produce greater wakefulness as a result of neuroplastic changes and more efficient processing.

In searching for the biological mechanisms underlying the beneficial impact of meditation, studies have revealed practice-induced alterations of neurotransmitters, brain activity, and cognitive abilities, just to name a few. These findings not only imply a close link between meditation and brain structure, but also suggest possible modulating effects of meditation on age-related brain atrophy. Given that normal aging is associated with significant loss of brain tissue, meditation-induced growth and/or preservation might manifest as a seemingly reduced brain age in meditators (i.e., cerebral measures characteristic of younger brains). Surprisingly, there are only three published studies that have addressed the question of whether meditation diminishes age-related brain degeneration. This paper reviews these three studies with respect to the brain attributes studied, the analytical strategies applied, and the findings revealed.

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive training programs may have the potential to counteract this decline. On the basis of a growing body of research that shows that meditation has positive effects on cognition in younger and middle-aged adults, meditation may be able to offset normal age-related cognitive decline or even enhance cognitive function in older adults. In this paper, we review studies investigating the effects of meditation on age-related cognitive decline. We searched the Web of Science (1900 to present), PsycINFO (1597 to present), MEDLINE (1950 to present), and CABI (1910 to present) to identify original studies investigating the effects of meditation on cognition and cognitive decline in the context of aging. Twelve studies were included in the review, six of which were randomized controlled trials. Studies involved a wide variety of meditation techniques and reported preliminary positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed, and general cognition.

Streamlining of psychotherapies is a necessary first step for this purpose. We suggest that neurobiological knowledge has reached the point of providing biologically meaningful behavioral targets, thus guiding the development of effective, simplified psychotherapies. This view is supported by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Project, which reflects the field's consensus and recognizes the readiness of neurobiology to guide research in treatment development. 'Engage' is an example of such a streamlined therapy. It targets behavioral domains of late-life depression grounded on RDoC constructs using efficacious behavioral strategies selected for their simplicity. 'Reward exposure' targeting the behavioral expression of positive valence systems' dysfunction is the principal therapeutic vehicle of 'Engage'. Its first three sessions consist of direct 'reward exposure', but the therapists search for barriers in three behavioral domains, that is, 'negativity bias' (negative valence), 'apathy' (arousal) and 'emotional dysregulation' (cognitive control), and add strategies targeting these domains when needed. The end result is a structured, stepped approach using neurobiological constructs as targets and as a guide to personalization. We argue that the 'reduction' process needed in order to arrive to simplified effective therapies can be achieved in three steps: (1) identify RDoC constructs driving the syndrome's psychopathology; (2) create a structured intervention utilizing behavioral and ecosystem modification techniques targeting behaviors related to these constructs; (3) examine whether the efficacy of the new intervention is mediated by change in behaviors related to the targeted RDoC constructs. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Engage; late-life depression; psychotherapy development; Rdoc; structured personalization","apathy; arousal; behavior change; brain region; cognition; cognitive defect; emotion; exercise; human; imagery; late life depression; meditation; neurobiology; priority journal; problem solving; psychotherapist; psychotherapy; review; reward; Behavioral Symptoms; Biomedical Research; Humans; Mental Disorders; Models, Psychological; Psychotherapy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891151265

Friedman test was used to compare the variables during different meditative phases. HR and BP revealed significant differences during different meditative phases. Pair-wise comparison revealed that HR decreased continuously and significantly while meditation advanced. On the other hand, none of HRV parameters reached statistical significance. Our findings reveal no significant differences between different meditative phases in terms of HRV parameters, but HR and BP continuously decrease while meditation advances.

Independent component analysis (ICA) has been shown to be a powerful computational tool for this purpose. Classic ICA has been successfully applied to single-subject fMRI data. The extension of ICA to group inferences in neuroimaging studies, however, is challenging due to the unavailability of a pre-specified group design matrix. Existing group ICA methods generally concatenate observed fMRI data across subjects on the temporal domain and then decompose multi-subject data in a similar manner to single-subject ICA. The major limitation of existing methods is that they ignore between-subject variability in spatial distributions of brain functional networks in group ICA. In this article, we propose a new hierarchical probabilistic group ICA method to formally model subject-specific effects in both temporal and spatial domains when decomposing multi-subject fMRI data. The proposed method provides model-based estimation of brain functional networks at both the population and subject level. An important advantage of the hierarchical model is that it provides a formal statistical framework to investigate similarities and differences in brain functional networks across subjects, for example, subjects with mental disorders or neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's as compared to normal subjects. We develop an EM algorithm for model estimation where both the E-step and M-step have explicit forms. We compare the performance of the proposed hierarchical model with that of two popular group ICA methods via simulation studies. We illustrate our method with application to an fMRI study of Zen meditation. © 2013, The International Biometric Society.","EM algorithm; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Group inferences; Hierarchical model; Independent component analysis; Maximum likelihood estimation; Multi-subject imaging data","algorithm; brain; computer simulation; data set; design; disease prevalence; matrix; numerical model; observational method; spatial distribution; article; biological model; brain; brain mapping; computer simulation; EM algorithm; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Group inferences; hierarchical model; human; independent component analysis; Maximum likelihood estimation; meditation; methodology; Multi-subject imaging data; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; principal component analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; EM algorithm; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Group inferences; Hierarchical model; Independent component analysis; Maximum likelihood estimation; Multi-subject imaging data; Brain; Brain Mapping; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Meditation; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Principal Component Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890310854

But, there are no studies which have assessed the effects of Brahma Kumaris Rajayoga Meditation (BKRM) practice on positive thinking and happiness in life. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis is BKRM enhances positive thinking and that essential to attain higher levels of self-satisfaction and happiness in life. Material and Methods: This study is a cross sectional comparative study which was done between Rajayoga meditators and non-meditators. This study was conducted at BKRM Centres at Manipal and Udupi in Karnataka, India. Fifty subjects were selected for this study, which included those practising BKRM in their normal routine life (n=25) and non-meditators (n=25) who were aged 42.95+/15.29 years. Self-reported Oxford happiness questionnaire (OHQ) was administered to all subjects and their happiness scores and status were assessed and compared. Items related to self-satisfaction in life were selected from the OHQ and compared between meditators and non-meditators. Participants completed self-reported OHQ, from which data of happiness status and self-satisfaction in relation to meditation duration and frequency were analyzed by descriptive statistics and test of hypothesis. Results: Mean happiness scores of BKRM were significantly higher (p<0.001) in meditators as compared to those in non-meditators. The number of meditators experiencing happiness status were significantly higher (p<0.05) in comparison with non-meditators. Additionally, meditators scored significantly higher on self-satisfaction items (p<0.001) as compared to non-meditators. There was no correlation between age and years of meditation practice with happiness score and self-satisfaction score. Conclusion: BKRM helps in significantly increasing self-satisfaction and happiness in life by enhancing positive thinking. Irrespective of age and years of short-term or long-term meditation practice, enhanced positive thinking increases self-satisfaction and happiness in life.","Brahmakumaris rajyoga meditation; Happiness; Positive thinking; Self-satisfaction","adult; age; article; comparative study; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; female; happiness; human; human experiment; India; life satisfaction; male; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; normal human; Oxford Happiness Questionnaire; positive thinking; self concept; self report; thinking; volunteer; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885236647

Methods: Data were collected using a web-based online anonymous survey under Institutional Review Board approval from Boston University. This report is based on 1327 responses from subjects with thyroid cancer. Patient factors were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: After excluding multivitamin and prayer use, 74% (n=941) used CAM. Respondents were primarily over age 40, white, and female and held a college degree. The top five modalities were massage therapy, chiropraxy, special diets, herbal tea, and yoga. Few patients reported perceiving a particular modality had a negative effect on treatment. CAM was more often used for treatment of symptoms (73%) than as part of thyroid cancer treatment (27%). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that patients reporting a poor health status, higher education, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary symptoms, or persistent, recurrent, or metastatic disease were more likely to use CAM for treatment of thyroid cancer symptoms. Nearly one third of respondents reported their CAM use was not known, prescribed, or asked about by their physicians. Conclusions: In comparison to national surveys of the general U.S. population, patients with thyroid cancer use CAM therapies twice as often and report their use far less often.

Lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, are recommended in conjunction with drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of impaired sleep. Preliminary evidence indicates that yoga - a mind-body practice and form of exercise - may improve sleep among cancer survivors. The primary aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to determine the efficacy of a standardized yoga intervention compared with standard care for improving global sleep quality (primary outcome) among post-treatment cancer survivors. Patients and Methods: In all, 410 survivors suffering from moderate or greater sleep disruption between 2 and 24 months after surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy were randomly assigned to standard care or standard care plus the 4-week yoga intervention. The yoga intervention used the Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS) program consisting of pranayama (breathing exercises), 16 Gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga asanas (postures), and meditation. Participants attended two 75-minute sessions per week. Sleep quality was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy pre- and postintervention. Results: In all, 410 survivors were accrued (96% female; mean age, 54 years; 75% had breast cancer). Yoga participants demonstrated greater improvements in global sleep quality and, secondarily, subjective sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and medication use at postintervention (all P ≤ .05) compared with standard care participants. Conclusion: Yoga, specifically the YOCAS program, is a useful treatment for improving sleep quality and reducing sleep medication use among cancer survivors. © 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"actimetry; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survivor; controlled study; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; meditation; multicenter study; patient care; patient compliance; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; sleep quality; yoga; alternative medicine; breathing exercise; cancer staging; clinical trial; intervention study; middle aged; Neoplasms; patient education; prognosis; psychology; quality of life; Sleep Disorders; survival rate; survivor; Breathing Exercises; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intervention Studies; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Therapies; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms; Patient Education as Topic; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Sleep Disorders; Survival Rate; Survivors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891549965

Both the male and female subjects were selected on the basis of their voluntary involvement. Visual reaction time for red and green light was recorded from all 60 subjects before the start of the study. Study group subjects were trained to practice various eye exercise techniques and kapalbhati pranayama for 8 weeks regularly whereas control group were busy with their routine activities. After 8 weeks, visual reaction time was measured for red and green light from all 60 subjects. Statistical Analysis: Data expressed as Mean ± S.D, Student t -test was applied for analysis of data, p value <0.05 is taken as statistically significant. Results: Statistical analysis of data shows that there is a significant decrease in the visual reaction time for red and green light after intervention in study group (p value <0.05). Whereas there is no significant decrease in VRT in control group (P value >0.05). Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that simple eye exercises along with pranayama helps in improvement of visual reaction time.","Eye Exercise; Kapalbhati pranayama; Visual reaction time (VRT)","adult; age distribution; article; case control study; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; exercise; eye exercise; female; green light; human; kapalbhati pranayama; light; male; medical practice; meditation; photostimulation; red light; response time; stimulus response; visual reaction time; visual stimulation; visual system parameters; voluntary movement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883886443

Patients and Methods This multisite, randomized controlled trial assigned 271 distressed survivors of stage I to III breast cancer to MBCR, SET, or a 1-day stress management control condition. MBCR focused on training in mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga, whereas SET focused on emotional expression and group support. Both intervention groups included 18 hours of professional contact. Measures were collected at baseline and after intervention by assessors blind to study condition. Primary outcome measures were mood and diurnal salivary cortisol slopes. Secondary outcomes were stress symptoms, quality of life, and social support. Results Using linear mixed-effects models, in intent-to-treat analyses, cortisol slopes were maintained over time in both SET (P = .002) and MBCR (P = .011) groups relative to the control group, whose cortisol slopes became flatter. Women in MBCR improved more over time on stress symptoms compared with women in both the SET (P = .009) and control (P = .024) groups. Per-protocol analyses showed greater improvements in the MBCR group in quality of life compared with the control group (P = .005) and in social support compared with the SET group (P =.012). Conclusion In the largest trial to date, MBCR was superior for improving stress levels, quality of life, and social support for distressed survivors of breast cancer. Both SET and MBCR also resulted in more normative diurnal cortisol profiles than the control condition.

Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which 57 cancer survivors with self-reported sleep disturbance received either a Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE; n = 18) control, or one of two experimental mind-body interventions, namely, Mind-Body Bridging (MBB; n = 19) or Mindfulness Meditation (MM; n = 20). Interventions were three sessions each conducted once per week for three consecutive weeks. Saliva cortisol and sAA were measured at baseline and 1 week after the last session. Participants also completed a sleep scale at the same time points when saliva was collected for biomarker measurement. Results: Our study revealed that at post-intervention assessment, mean sAA levels upon awakening (""Waking"" sample) declined in MBB compared with that of SHE. Mean Waking cortisol levels did not differ among treatment groups but declined slightly in SHE. Self-reported sleep improved across the three interventions at Post-assessment, with largest improvements in the MBB intervention. Conclusion: In this exploratory study, sleep focused mind-body intervention (MBB) attenuated Waking sAA levels, suggesting positive influences of a mind-body intervention on sympathetic activity in cancer survivors with sleep disturbance. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomarker; Cancer survivor; Mind-body intervention; Salivary α-amylase; Salivary cortisol; Sleep disturbance; Stress; Sympathetic nervous system","amylase; hydrocortisone; adult; aged; article; cancer survivor; controlled study; education program; exploratory research; female; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; meditation; mind body bridging; mindfulness meditation; patient education; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; saliva level; sleep disorder; sleep hygiene education; sleep therapy; treatment outcome; treatment response; Biomarker; Cancer survivor; Mind-body intervention; Salivary cortisol; Salivary α-amylase; Sleep disturbance; Stress; Sympathetic nervous system; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Markers; Dyssomnias; Female; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Therapies; Mindfulness; Neoplasms; Patient Education as Topic; Psychophysiology; Saliva; Salivary alpha-Amylases; Self-Help Groups; Survivors; Sympathetic Nervous System; Treatment Outcome; Wakefulness; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883653841

In the last 20 decades, there has been a surge of interest in the research of stress-induced manifestations and this approach has resulted in the development of more appropriate animal models for stress-associated pathologies and its therapeutic management. These stress models are an easy and convenient method for inducing both psychological and physical stress. To understand the behavioral changes underlying major depression, molecular and cellular studies are required. Dysregulation of the stress system may lead to disturbances in growth and development, and may this may further lead to the development of various other psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the different types of stress and their neurobiology, including the different neurotransmitters affected. There are various complications associated with stress and their management through various pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques. The use of herbs in the treatment of stress-related problems is practiced in both Indian and Western societies, and it has a vast market in terms of anti-stress medications and treatments. Non-pharmacological techniques such as meditation and yoga are nowadays becoming very popular as a stress-relieving therapy because of their greater effectiveness and no associated side effects. Therefore, this review highlights the changes under stress and stressor and their impact on different animal models in understanding the mechanisms of stress along with their effective and safe management.","Animal models; depression; manifestations; neurotransmitters; stress; therapeutic management","4 aminobutyric acid; alpha tocopherol; amitriptyline; ascorbic acid; Azadirachta indica extract; beta carotene; buspirone; chlordiazepoxide; corticotropin; corticotropin releasing factor; diazepam; dopamine; doxepin; flurazepam; ginseng extract; glucocorticoid; glutamic acid; hydrocortisone; melatonin; mirtazapine; naproxen; neurotransmitter; noradrenalin; Rhodiola rosea extract; rofecoxib; serotonin; tandospirone; trazodone; unindexed drug; Withania somnifera extract; alternative medicine; amnesia; antioxidant activity; anxiety disorder; behavior change; cardiovascular disease; coping behavior; depression; disease association; exercise; experimental model; herbal medicine; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; infection sensitivity; lipid peroxidation; major depression; medical research; meditation; mental disease; mental stress; motivation; neurobiology; nonhuman; noradrenalin release; obesity; osteoporosis; oxidative stress; physical stress; priority journal; psychological well being; relaxation training; review; sedation; stress management; tranquilizing activity; yoga; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878532469

The process of meditation apparently increases activation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and stimulates the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, implicating the production and delivery of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABAergic inhibitory interneurons have a central role in cortical inhibition (CI), modulating cortical excitability and neural plasticity. Objective/hypothesis: Changes in CI, after completion of a single meditation session, were investigated and compared to a non-meditating control activity. Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive method of examining CI, was used to evaluate changes before and after a 60 min meditation session. Seventy right-handed healthy subjects (n = 35 meditators, n = 35 non-meditators) were assessed using TMS related measures of cortical silent period (CSP) and short intra cortical inhibition (SICI), with stimulation of the motor cortex coordinated with EMG recording of peripheral hand muscles. Results: For the meditators, CSP and SICI were measured before and after meditation sessions while age-sex matched healthy control subjects were identically assessed after a non-meditating activity (television watching). The meditators showed a statistically significant increase in CSP after meditation compared to non-meditators after an equivalent period of television watching (P = 0.02) while no significant between-group differences were observed in the SICI. Conclusion: These findings indicate meditation processes are linked to GABAergic cortical inhibition, a mechanism previously implicated in improved cognitive performance and enhanced emotional regulation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Millennia-old practices evoking the RR include meditation, yoga and repetitive prayer. Although RR elicitation is an effective therapeutic intervention that counteracts the adverse clinical effects of stress in disorders including hypertension, anxiety, insomnia and aging, the underlying molecular mechanisms that explain these clinical benefits remain undetermined. To assess rapid time-dependent (temporal) genomic changes during one session of RR practice among healthy practitioners with years of RR practice and also in novices before and after 8 weeks of RR training, we measured the transcriptome in peripheral blood prior to, immediately after, and 15 minutes after listening to an RR-eliciting or a health education CD. Both short-term and long-term practitioners evoked significant temporal gene expression changes with greater significance in the latter as compared to novices. RR practice enhanced expression of genes associated with energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, insulin secretion and telomere maintenance, and reduced expression of genes linked to inflammatory response and stress-related pathways. Interactive network analyses of RR-affected pathways identified mitochondrial ATP synthase and insulin (INS) as top upregulated critical molecules (focus hubs) and NF-κB pathway genes as top downregulated focus hubs. Our results for the first time indicate that RR elicitation, particularly after long-term practice, may evoke its downstream health benefits by improving mitochondrial energy production and utilization and thus promoting mitochondrial resiliency through upregulation of ATPase and insulin function. Mitochondrial resiliency might also be promoted by RR-induced downregulation of NF-κB-associated upstream and downstream targets that mitigates stress. © 2013 Bhasin et al.",,"immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; insulin; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; transcriptome; autacoid; insulin; nitric oxide; transcriptome; article; blood analysis; clinical practice; controlled study; disorders of mitochondrial functions; DNA flanking region; down regulation; downstream processing; energy metabolism; evoked response; gene expression; gene expression regulation; genetic association; health practitioner; human; human cell; human experiment; inflammation; insulin release; mitochondrial energy transfer; mitochondrial respiration; nervous system parameters; normal human; relaxation response; stress; telomere homeostasis; upregulation; cross-sectional study; DNA microarray; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; immune system; leisure; meditation; metabolism; mitochondrion; physiological stress; physiology; prospective study; religion; secretion (process); yoga; Cross-Sectional Studies; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Immune System; Inflammation Mediators; Insulin; Meditation; Mitochondria; Nitric Oxide; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Prospective Studies; Relaxation; Religion; Stress, Physiological; Telomere Homeostasis; Transcriptome; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877045019

This highlights the need for more rigorous research into CAM. This article is aimed at critically reviewing surveys that examine the prevalence of CAM use by menopausal women worldwide. Eleven databases were searched for peer-reviewed surveys published in any language between 01 January 2000 and 27 October 2012. The bibliographies of the retrieved articles and relevant book chapters were also hand searched. Twenty-six surveys were identified, and they included a total of 32,465 menopausal women. The majority of these surveys were of poor methodological quality. Based on 6 surveys, 32.9% of women stated they were current/regular CAM users. Based on 9 surveys, 50.5% of women reported that they used CAM specifically for their menopausal symptoms. The average 12-month prevalence of CAM use was 47.7% (range: 33.1-56.2). Fifty-five percent of women did not disclose their use of CAM to their healthcare professional. The majority of women sought information about CAM from the media. The most popular CAM modality was herbal medicine, followed by soy/phytoestrogens, evening primrose oil, relaxation and yoga.

Despite the known negative impact of FCR on psychological wellbeing and quality of life, little research has investigated interventions for high FCR. Our team has developed and piloted a novel intervention (Conquer Fear) based on the Self-Regulatory Executive Function Model and Relational Frame Theory and is evaluating Conquer Fear in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to compare the efficacy and cost-efficacy of the Conquer Fear Intervention and relaxation training in reducing the impact of FCR.Methods/design: This study is a multi-centre RCT with 260 participants randomised either to the Conquer Fear Intervention or relaxation training. Both interventions will be delivered in five sessions over 10 weeks by trained psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers with five or more years experience in oncology. Conquer Fear sessions use attentional training, detached mindfulness, meta-cognitive therapy, values clarification and psycho-education to help patients change the way they regulate and respond to thoughts about cancer recurrence. Relaxation training includes training in progressive and passive muscle relaxation, meditative relaxation, visualisation and "" quick relaxation"" techniques. Relaxation was chosen to control for therapist time and attention and has good face-validity as an intervention. The primary outcome is fear of cancer recurrence. Secondary outcomes include distress, quality of life, unmet needs, and health care utilisation. Participants complete questionnaires prior to starting the intervention, immediately after completing the intervention, 3 and 6 months later. Eligible participants are early-stage breast or colorectal cancer survivors who have completed hospital-based treatment between 2 months and 5 years prior to study entry and report a score in the clinical range on the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory. The biostatistician is blinded to group allocation and participants are blinded to which intervention is being evaluated. Randomisation is computer generated, stratified by therapist, and uses sequentially numbered sealed envelopes.Discussion: If successful, the study will provide an evidence-based intervention to reduce psychological morbidity in cancer survivors, and reduce overall health care costs due to more appropriate use of follow-up care and other health services in this very large population.Trial registration: Trial registration: ACTRN12612000404820. © 2013 Butow et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cancer; Detached mindfulness; Fear of cancer recurrence; Intervention; Metacognition; Oncology; RCT; S-REF model","article; attention; breast cancer; cancer recurrence; cancer survivor; cognitive therapy; colorectal cancer; conquer fear; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; distress syndrome; fear; fear of cancer recurrence; health care need; health care utilization; human; major clinical study; meditation; multicenter study; muscle relaxation; psychoeducation; psychotherapy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; relaxation training; treatment outcome; adaptive behavior; clinical trial; fear; follow up; intervention study; mental stress; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasms; Phobic Disorders; pilot study; prevention and control; procedures; prognosis; psychology; questionnaire; survivor; Adaptation, Psychological; Cognitive Therapy; Fear; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intervention Studies; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasms; Phobic Disorders; Pilot Projects; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Stress, Psychological; Survivors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876732130

Previous work has shown that yoga may improve wellness in healthy people and have benefits for patients. However, the mechanisms of how yoga may positively affect the mind-body system are largely unknown. Here we have assessed possible rapid changes in global gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in healthy people that practiced either a comprehensive yoga program or a control regimen. The experimental sessions included gentle yoga postures, breathing exercises, and meditation (Sudarshan Kriya and Related Practices - SK&P) compared with a control regimen of a nature walk and listening to relaxing music. We show that the SK&P program has a rapid and significantly greater effect on gene expression in PBMCs compared with the control regimen.

Using high-resolution MRI of 22 Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) practitioners and 18 controls matched for age, sex and education, we set out to examine the underlying anatomical correlates of long-term Taichi practice at two different levels of regional specificity. For this purpose, parcel-wise and vertex-wise analyses were employed to quantify the difference between TCC practitioners and the controls based on cortical surface reconstruction. We also adopted the Attention Network Test (ANT) to explore the effect of TCC on executive control. TCC practitioners, compared with controls, showed significantly thicker cortex in precentral gyrus, insula sulcus and middle frontal sulcus in the right hemisphere and superior temporal gyrus and medial occipito-temporal sulcus and lingual sulcus in the left hemisphere. Moreover, we found that thicker cortex in left medial occipito-temporal sulcus and lingual sulcus was associated with greater intensity of TCC practice. These findings indicate that long-term TCC practice could induce regional structural change and also suggest TCC might share similar patterns of neural correlates with meditation and aerobic exercise. © 2013 Wei et al.",,"adult; aerobic exercise; article; brain cortex; brain morphometry; brain region; controlled study; executive function; female; human; human experiment; insula; insula sulcus; left hemisphere; lingual sulcus; male; medial occipito temporal sulcus; meditation; middle frontal sulcus; morphometrics; primary motor cortex; right hemisphere; superior temporal gyrus; Tai Chi; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Exercise; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Psychological Tests; Tai Ji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876016195

This study compares the results of our study on cardiorespiratory interactions for novice (control group) and experienced (experimental group) Chan meditation practitioners. The effectual co-action between the cardiac and respiratory systems was evaluated by the degree of cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CRPS). In addition, an adaptive-frequency-range (AFR) scheme to reliably quantify heart rate variability (HRV) was developed for assessing the regulation of sympathetic-parasympathetic activity and the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange. The enhanced HRV method, named HRVAFR, can resolve the issue of overestimating HRV under the condition of slow respiration rates, which is frequently encountered in studies on Chan meditation practitioners. In the comparison of the three data sets collected from the two groups, our findings resulted in innovative hypotheses to interpret the extraordinary process of the rejuvenation of cardiorespiratory functions through long-term Dharma-Chan meditation practice. Particularly, advanced practitioners exhibit a continuously high degree of cardiorespiratory phase synchronization, even during rapid breathing. Based on our post-experimental interview with advanced practitioners, the activation of inner Chakra energy, during the course of Chan-detachment practice, frequently induces perceptible physiological-mental reformation, including an efficient mechanism for regulating cardiorespiratory interactions. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"adult; aged; article; cardiac resynchronization therapy; cardiorespiratory phase synchronization; controlled study; dharma chan meditation; female; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; lung gas exchange; male; meditation; normal human; parasympathetic tone; priority journal; Adult; Aged; Electrodes; Female; Heart; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Respiration; Time Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876515331

Breathing pacer is usually helpful for a user to learn to control breathing and restore an optimal breathing pattern. In this paper, a wearable physiological monitoring system supporting real-time breathing biofeedback is presented. An elastic T-shirt with two inductive bands integrated in the positions of rib cage (RC) and abdomen (AB) is used as a motherboard both for physiological monitoring and respiratory biofeedback. Physiological signals such as RC and AB respiration, electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmograph (PPG) and artery pulse wave (APW) can be sampled, stored and transmitted wirelessly. When this system is used in biofeedback applications, respiratory signals are processed in real-time by a peak-detection algorithm to recognize the concurrent breathing pattern. By comparing the actual breathing rate with the guiding breathing rate, an audio biofeedback is generated by playing music audios stored in the Micro-SD card through an MP3 decoder chip VS1053. With this design, multiple functions of physiological monitoring, real-time signal processing and audio biofeedback were integrated in one wearable system. Experiment showed that through audio biofeedback this system can guide the user to practice a slow and regular breathing effectively. Physiological data recorded from a Yoga practitioner during meditation demonstrated the capability of the system to acquire cardiopulmonary physiological data during slow breathing. This system is a useful tool both for breathing biofeedback training and its related scientific researches. © 2013 National Taiwan University.","Audio biofeedback; Breathing pattern; Real-time signal processing; Respiratory biofeedback; Respiratory inductive plethysmography; Wearable system","Breathing patterns; Inductive plethysmographies; Physiological monitoring; Physiological monitoring systems; Physiological signals; Real-time signal processing; Scientific researches; Wearable systems; Audio acoustics; Cardiovascular system; Electrocardiography; Patient monitoring; Signal processing; Wearable computers; Biofeedback; algorithm; article; auditory feedback; breathing pattern; breathing rate; cardiopulmonary function; electrocardiography; feedback system; human; meditation; photoelectric plethysmography; physiological process; pulse wave; signal processing; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876274163

Previous studies have reported positive effects of a structured 8-week group mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) among patients with cancer and other conditions. Purpose: To test the effect of such a programme on anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer in a population-based randomised controlled study. Methods: A total of 336 women who had been operated on for breast cancer (stage I-III) were randomised to usual care or MBSR + usual care. Questionnaires including the Symptom Checklist-90r anxiety and depression subscales and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale were administered before randomisation and immediately, 6 and 12 months after the intervention. Results: Intention-to-treat analyses showed differences between groups in levels of anxiety (p = 0.0002) and depression (SCL-90r, p < 0.0001; CES-D, p = 0.0367) after 12 months. Graphical comparisons of participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline showed a significantly greater decrease in the intervention group throughout follow-up and no differences among least affected participants. Medium-to-large effects were found for all outcomes in the intervention group in analyses of change scores after 12 months' follow-up. Conclusion: The 8-week group based MBSR intervention had clinically meaningful, statistically significant effects on depression and anxiety after 12 months' follow-up, and medium-to-large effect sizes. Our findings support the dissemination of MBSR among women with breast cancer. (Clintrials.gov No.: NCT00990977). © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Study 1 was conducted in remote monasteries of eastern Tibet with expert meditators performing g-tummo practices while their axillary temperature and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity were measured. Study 2 was conducted with Western participants (a non-meditator control group) instructed to use the somatic component of the g-tummo practice (vase breathing) without utilization of meditative visualization. Reliable increases in axillary temperature from normal to slight or moderate fever zone (up to 38.3°C) were observed among meditators only during the Forceful Breath type of g-tummo meditation accompanied by increases in alpha, beta, and gamma power. The magnitude of the temperature increases significantly correlated with the increases in alpha power during Forceful Breath meditation. The findings indicate that there are two factors affecting temperature increase. The first is the somatic component which causes thermogenesis, while the second is the neurocognitive component (meditative visualization) that aids in sustaining temperature increases for longer periods.

The present study examined if a yogic meditation might alter the activity of inflammatory and antiviral transcription control pathways that shape immune cell gene expression. Methods: Forty-five family dementia caregivers were randomized to either Kirtan Kriya Meditation (KKM) or Relaxing Music (RM) listening for 12. min daily for 8 weeks and 39 caregivers completed the study. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles were collected from peripheral blood leukocytes sampled at baseline and 8-week follow-up. Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses tested the hypothesis that observed transcriptional alterations were structured by reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-κB family of transcription factors and increased activity of Interferon Response Factors (IRFs; i.e., reversal of patterns previously linked to stress). Results: In response to KKM treatment, 68 genes were found to be differentially expressed (19 up-regulated, 49 down-regulated) after adjusting for potentially confounded differences in sex, illness burden, and BMI. Up-regulated genes included immunoglobulin-related transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts included pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation-related immediate-early genes. Transcript origin analyses identified plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes as the primary cellular context of these transcriptional alterations (both p<. .001). Promoter-based bioinformatic analysis implicated reduced NF-κB signaling and increased activity of IRF1 in structuring those effects (both p<. .05). Conclusion: A brief daily yogic meditation intervention may reverse the pattern of increased NF-κB-related transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased IRF1-related transcription of innate antiviral response genes previously observed in healthy individuals confronting a significant life stressor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Dementia caregiver; Gene expression profiling; Genomics; Kirtan Kriya; Meditation; Microarray; NF-κB; Relaxation; Stress; Yoga","cytokine; immediate early protein; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interferon regulatory factor; interferon regulatory factor 1; adult; article; B lymphocyte; bioinformatics; body mass; caregiver; caregiver burden; controlled study; dementia; down regulation; female; follow up; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene identification; genetic transcription; human; human cell; human experiment; leukocyte; male; meditation; normal human; plasmacytoid dendritic cell; priority journal; promoter region; randomized controlled trial; relaxation training; upregulation; yoga; Caregivers; Dementia; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Interferon Regulatory Factors; Leukocytes; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; NF-kappa B; Transcriptome; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875277860

The stress response and its correlation to chronic disorders such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, metabolic syndrome, and chronic pain are comprehensively explored. Current mind-body theoretical models, including peripheral nerve pathway, neurophysiological, and integrative theories, are reviewed to elucidate the biological mechanisms behind psychophysiological interventions. Specific interventions included are psychotherapy, mindfulness meditation, yoga, and psychopharmacology. Finally, the author advocates for an integrated care approach as a means by which to blur the sharp distinction between physical and psychological health. Integrated care approaches can utilize psychiatric nurse practitioners for behavioral assessment, intervention, research, advocacy, consultation, and education to optimize health outcomes. © 2013.","Acceptance and commitment therapy; Anger; Autoimmune disease; Cardiovascular disease; Chronic pain; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Cynicism; Depression; Dialectical behavioral therapy; Gastrointestinal disease; Hypothalamic-pituitary axis; Integrative medicine; Metabolic syndrome; Mindfulness meditation; Optimism; Positive psychotherapy; Psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner; Psychodynamic psychiatry; Stress; Sympathetic nervous system; Type D personality; Vitality; Yoga","antidepressant agent; paroxetine; acceptance and commitment therapy; alternative medicine; article; autoimmune disease; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; chronic pain; clinical assessment; cognitive therapy; consultation; depression; dialectical behavior therapy; disease association; gastrointestinal disease; human; integrated health care system; irritable colon; meditation; metabolic syndrome X; mindfulness meditation; neurophysiology; nonhuman; nurse practitioner; nursing research; patient advocacy; patient education; peripheral nerve; physical disease; physiological stress; positive clinical psychology; psychodynamics; psychopharmacology; psychophysiology; psychosomatic disorder; psychotherapy; theoretical model; yoga; acceptance and commitment therapy; anger; autoimmune disease; cardiovascular disease; chronic pain; cognitive behavioral therapy; cynicism; depression; dialectical behavioral therapy; gastrointestinal disease; hypothalamic-pituitary axis; integrative medicine; metabolic syndrome; mindfulness meditation; optimism; positive psychotherapy; psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner; psychodynamic psychiatry; stress; sympathetic nervous system; Type D personality; vitality; yoga; Chronic Disease; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Psychophysics; Psychophysiology; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875125728

Increased inflammation in individuals with ELA is believed to drive the elevated risk for medical and psychiatric illness in the same individuals. This study sought to determine whether Cognitively Based Compassion Training (CBCT) reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) in adolescents in foster care with high rates of ELA, and to evaluate the relationship between CBCT engagement and changes in CRP given prior evidence from our group for an effect of practice on inflammatory markers. It was hypothesized that increasing engagement would be associated with reduced CRP from baseline to the 6-week assessment. Methods: Seventy-one adolescents in the Georgia foster care system (31 females), aged 13-17, were randomized to either 6 weeks of CBCT or a wait-list condition. State records were used to obtain information about each participant's history of trauma and neglect, as well as reason for placement in foster care. Saliva was collected before and again after 6 weeks of CBCT or the wait-list condition. Participants in the CBCT group completed practice diaries as a means of assessing engagement with the CBCT. Results: No difference between groups was observed in salivary CRP concentrations. Within the CBCT group, practice sessions during the study correlated with reduced CRP from baseline to the 6-week assessment. Conclusions: Engagement with CBCT may positively impact inflammatory measures relevant to health in adolescents at high risk for poor adult functioning as a result of significant ELA, including individuals placed in foster care. Longer term follow-up will be required to evaluate if these changes are maintained and translate into improved health outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Compassion meditation; CRP; Early life adversity; Foster care; Inflammation; Saliva","C reactive protein; adolescent; article; behavior; Cognitively-Based Compassion Training; controlled study; female; foster care; human; injury; major clinical study; male; mental stress; neglect; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; saliva analysis; training; United States; Adolescent; Anxiety; Biological Markers; C-Reactive Protein; Cognitive Therapy; Depression; Female; Foster Home Care; Humans; Male; Psychotherapy, Group; Saliva; Stress, Psychological; Waiting Lists",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872869830

The book is divided into four parts: epidemiology, epigenetics, pathobiology, and therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Part I details epidemiological studies, highlighting the extent of the clinical problem. Part II describes the genetic and, primarily, epigenetic modifications associated with cardiovascular disease, including the importance of DNA methylation status and the possibility of early intervention using simple dietary modifications. The text also discusses histone modifications associated with disease and potential therapeutic synthetic and dietary compounds such as resveratrol and garlic. Covering the etiology and pathobiology, part III discusses lipid regulation, micro-RNAs, emerging cell-based therapies, and new receptor targets for therapeutics as well as targeted imaging. It also describes the link between cancer therapies and cardiomyopathy and the potential of vitamin C to ameliorate this effect. Part IV focuses on therapeutic and nutritional interventions, namely, stem cell therapies, emerging nanomedicines, and a wide range of dietary interventions. These include general healthy diets, fruits and vegetables, botanicals, effects of specific compounds such as antioxidants, and discussions on garlic, curcumin, and resveratrol. The text also covers lifestyle factors, emphasizing the importance of stress in the occurrence of and meditation and yoga in the management of cardiovascular disease.

Methods: 9 patients treated with SBRT and 8 treated with IMRT were scanned with 4D CT and the breathing patterns were acquired. One of the SBRT patients was scanned with and without meditation. Each breathing signal consisted of a scalar time series and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) was utilized to determine the following measures: Periodicity of the system as percentage of recurrence points (%RR), determinism (DET), maximum diagonal line length (L_max) whose inverse the divergence (DIV) is measure for how fast trajectories diverge from each other, the average diagonal line length (L) that can be interpreted as the mean prediction time of the signal, and the entropy (ENTR) a measure of information complexity. In addition the invariant measures of K2 and D2 were also estimated. A locally nonlinear forecast was applied to predict future breathing signals of N time step ahead for the patient with and without meditation. Results: Our results showed %RR has significant correlation with L_max and has inverse correlation with DIV. DET has significant correlation with Lmax, L, ENTR and DIV. Independent t test suggests there is no difference between the SBRT and IMRT groups in terms of the RQA measures and K2. Patient that had undergone meditation showed improvement in %RR, L_max, DIV, K2 and had an estimated correlation dimension of 1.7. Prediction showed similar results for one and three time step ahead but meditation one had better prediction horizon when time step was higher. Conclusion: RQA is a powerful tool that allows one to analyze the dynamic nature of breathing pattern. No significant difference was found in the dynamical complexity of SBRT and IMRT patients. © 2013, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health. Methods: This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD. Results: The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal. Conclusions: Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care.

Materials/Methods: A validated CAM instrument with a self-skin assessment was administered to 360 Stage 0-III breast cancer patients from 5 centers during the last week of radiation. All data were analyzed to detect significant differences between users/nonusers. Results: CAM usage was reported in 54% of the study cohort (n=194/360). Of CAM users, 71% reported activity-based CAM (eg, Reiki, meditation), 26% topical CAM, and 45% oral CAM. Only 16% received advice/counseling from naturopathic/ homeopathic/medical professionals before initiating CAM. CAM use significantly correlated with higher education level (P<.001), inversely correlated with concomitant hormone/radiation therapy use (P=.010), with a trend toward greater use in younger patients (P=.066). On multivariate analysis, level of education (OR: 6.821, 95% CI: 2.307-20.168, P<.001) and hormones/radiation therapy (OR: 0.573, 95% CI: 0.347-0.949, P=.031) independently predicted for CAM use. Significantly lower skin toxicity scores were reported in CAM users vs nonusers, respectively (mild: 34% vs 25%, severe: 17% vs 29%, P=.017). Conclusion: This is the first prospective study to assess CAM practices in breast patients during radiation, with definition of these practices as the first step for future investigation of CAM/radiation interactions. These results should alert radiation oncologists that a large percentage of breast cancer patients use CAM during radiation without disclosure or consideration for potential interactions, and should encourage increased awareness, communication, and documentation of CAM practices in patients undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",,"Activity-based; Breast Cancer; Complementary and alternative medicines; Higher education; Multi variate analysis; Multicenter study; Prospective study; Radiation oncologists; Radiation treatments; Skin toxicity; Diseases; Radiation; Radiotherapy; Cams; alpha tocopherol; biotin; calcium; Chlorella extract; Cimicifuga racemosa extract; copper; Echinacea extract; emodin; folic acid; glutamine; grape seed extract; isoflavone derivative; magnesium; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; primrose oil; retinol; selenium; turmeric; ubidecarenone; vitamin D; vitamin K group; xanthophyll; acupuncture; adult; alternative medicine; article; awareness; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer staging; cohort analysis; disease severity; education; female; health care utilization; homeopathy; human; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; massage; medical documentation; medical specialist; meditation; multicenter study; paramedical personnel; patient counseling; priority journal; prospective study; radiation oncologist; reflexology; Reiki; self evaluation; self skin assessment; skin toxicity; yoga; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Counseling; Disclosure; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Radiodermatitis; Radiotherapy Dosage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871398039

Hypoxia increases CSC fraction and promotes acquisition of a stem-cell-like state. Cancer stem cells are critically dependant on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) for survival, self-renewal, tumor growth and maintenance of their undifferentiated phenotype. Recent researches show that stage of differentiation of the tumor cells is predictive of their susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity and cancer stem cells are significant targets of NK cell cytotoxicity. Studies also show that reversion of tumor cells to a less-differentiated phenotype can be achieved by blocking NFκB. Yoga therapy (yogic lifestyle modifications encompassing physical postures, breathing practices, relaxation techniques and meditations) is known to modulate neural, endocrine and immune functions at the cellular level through influencing cell cycle control, aging, oxidative stress, apoptosis and several pathways of stress signaling molecules. Yoga therapy has also been shown to enhance natural killer cell activity and modulate stress and DNA damage in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Recent study found that brief daily yogic meditation may reverse the pattern of increased NFκB-related transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines in leukocytes. Thus, yoga therapy has the potential to reduce cancer stem cell survival, self-renewal and tumor growth by modifying the tumor micro-environment through various mechanisms such as; 1) reducing HIF-1 activity by enhanced oxygenation, 2) promoting NK cell activity directly (or indirectly through down regulating NFκB expression), thereby enhancing NK cell mediated CSC lysis, and 3) by minimizing the aberrant expressions or activities of various hormones, cytokines, chemokines and tumor signaling pathways. Yoga therapy may have a synergistic effect with conventional modalities of treatment in preventing cancer progression and recurrences. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Breathing techniques; Cancer stem cells; Hypoxia; Meditation; NK cells; Yoga","cancer stem cell; cell hypoxia; human; immunology; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; neoplasm; pathology; review; signal transduction; treatment outcome; tumor microenvironment; yoga; cancer stem cell; Neoplasms; Cell Hypoxia; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Neoplasms; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Signal Transduction; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Microenvironment; Yoga; Cell Hypoxia; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Neoplasms; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Signal Transduction; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Microenvironment; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891549454

Yoga stands third amongst all CAM that is being used by cancer patients today. Different schools of yoga use different sets of practices, with some using a more physical approach and many using meditation and/or breathing. All these modules are developed based on the needs of the patient. This paper is an attempt to provide the basis for a comprehensive need based integrative yoga module for cancer patients at different stages of treatment and follow up. In this paper, the holistic modules of the integrated approach of yoga therapy for cancer (IAYTC) have been developed based on the patient needs, as per the observations by the clinicians and the caregivers. Authors have attempted to systematically create holistic modules of IAYTC for various stages of the disease and treatment. These modules have been used in randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy and have shown to be effective as addon to conventional management of cancer. Thus, the objective of this effort was to present the theoretical basis and validate the need based holistic yoga modules for cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Literature from traditional texts including Vedas, Ayurveda, Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita, Yoga Vasishtha etc. and their commentaries were looked into for references of cancer and therapeutic directives. Present day scientific literature was also explored with regards to defining cancer, its etiopathology and its management. Results of studies done using CAM therapies were also looked at, for salient findings. Focused group discussions (FGD) amongst researchers, experienced gurus, and medical professionals involved in research and clinical cancer practice were carried out with the objectives of determining needs of the patient and yoga practices that could prove efficient. A list of needs at different stages of conventional therapies (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) was listed and yoga modules were developed accordingly. Considering the needs, expected side effects, the energy levels and the psychological states of the participants, eight modules evolved. Results: The results of the six steps for developing the validated module are reported. Step 1: Literature review from traditional yoga and ayurveda texts on etiopathogenesis and management of cancer (arbuda), and the recent literature on cancer stem cells and immunology of cancer. Step 2: Focused group discussions and deliberations to compile the needs of patients based on the expected side effects, energy levels and the psychological state of the patient as observed by the caregivers and the clinicians. Step 3: Content validation through consensus by the experts for the eight modules of IAYTC that could be used as complimentary to conventional management of cancer at different stages during and after the diagnosis was created. Step 4: Field testing for safety and feasibility of the modules through pilot studies. Step 5: Compilation of the results of efficacy trials through RCTs and step 6: A review of our studies on mechanisms to offer evidence for action of IAYTC on psycho-neuro-immunological pathways in cancer. Conclusion: The evidence from the traditional knowledge and recent scientific studies validates eight modules of integrated approach of yoga therapy for cancer that can be used safely and effectively as c mplimentary during all conventional cancer therapies. © Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Cancer; Cancer stem cells; Traditional knowledge; Yoga","evidence based medicine; human; information processing; mental health; methodology; multimodality cancer therapy; Neoplasms; pathology; pathophysiology; philosophy; program development; program evaluation; psychology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; treatment outcome; validation study; yoga; article; neoplasm; psychological aspect; Combined Modality Therapy; Evidence-Based Medicine; Focus Groups; Holistic Health; Humans; Mental Health; Neoplasms; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Yoga; Combined Modality Therapy; Evidence-Based Medicine; Focus Groups; Holistic Health; Humans; Mental Health; Neoplasms; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891544672

We used middle latency response (MLR), event related potentials P300-ERP and contingent negative variation (CNV) and Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) - a standard neuropsychological test were used to evaluate cognitive impairment after total sleep deprivation (SD); and to study the impact of meditation as an intervention for this impairment. Methods: Healthy male volunteers (n=10) drawn randomly from the Indian Army participated in a 6-night study design executed before and after two months of meditation practice: night 1-adaptation, night 2-baseline, night 3-24 h SD, night 4-recovery sleep, night 5-24 h SD after 60 days meditation, night 6-recovery sleep after SD. A 36 h SD was obtained by keeping the subject awake for 12 h after 24 h SD. Results: The latency and amplitude of P300 increased after 36 h SD. Amplitudes and latencies of both early and late CNV increased after 24 and 36 h SD, indicating defcient orientation and impairment of attention and perception. Prolonged CNV reaction time after 36 h SD manifested defcient motor response following second (imperative) stimulus. Latency of MLR Na registered signifcant change following 36 h SD compared to baseline (P<0.01) and recovery (P<0.05). RAPM score showed signifcant decrease after 36 h of wakefulness indicating impaired analytical ability and diffculty in problem solving. None of these parameters showed any signifcant alteration after SD, following meditation practice. Interpretation & conclusions: The present results showed that SD impaired cognitive performance to graded extents signifcantly, but this deterioration could be improved to a signifcant extent using meditation.","Cognitive functions; Contingent negative variation; Event related potentials; Middle latency response; P300; Raven's advanced progressive matrices; Reaction time; Sleep deprivation","actimetry; adaptation; adult; article; attention; cognitive defect; contingent negative variation; evoked response; human; human experiment; male; meditation; neuropsychological test; normal human; perception; psychologic assessment; sleep deprivation; wakefulness; analysis of variance; Cognition Disorders; complication; evaluation study; event related potential; India; meditation; physiology; procedures; psychology; reaction time; sleep deprivation; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Cognition Disorders; Contingent Negative Variation; Event-Related Potentials, P300; Humans; India; Male; Meditation; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Sleep Deprivation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84873178133

Meditation is known to be beneficial for health improvement and illness reduction and many studies on meditation have been made, from both the physiological and psychological points of view. It is a fundamental requirement of meditation practice to be able to sit without body motion. In this study, a novel body motion monitoring and estimation system has been developed. A wireless tri-axis accelerometer is used to measure body motion. Both a mean and maximum motion index is derived from the square summation of three axes. Two experiments were conducted in this study. The first experiment was to investigate the motion index baseline among three leg-crossing postures. The second experiment was to observe posture dynamics for thirty minute's meditation.Twenty-six subjects participated in the experiments. In one experiment, thirteen subjects were recruited from an experienced meditation group (meditation experience > 3 years); and the other thirteen subjects were beginners (meditation experience < 1 years). There was a significant posture stability difference between both groups in terms of either mean or maximum parameters (p < 0.05), according to the results of the experiment.

A biopsychosocial model will help elucidate the systemic interrelationships between psychosocial and bio-physiological factors for the development of systems medicine. Many evidences have supported the close relationships between stress, depression, inflammation, and disorders including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, skin diseases, infectious diseases, and sleep disorders. As inflammation is a critical connection among different diseases, the elucidation of the associations may contribute to the findings of systemic therapeutic targets.

The prevalence of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment in cancer survivors ranges from 14 to 85 %. Memory loss and lack of concentration are the most frequent symptoms, often resulting in deterioration of daily functioning and a decreased quality of life. Despite ongoing research on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment, a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the neurotoxicity induced by chemotherapy and the factors that determine a patient's vulnerability are still lacking. We review current knowledge regarding the etiology of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment, risk factors, conventional therapy, coping strategies, and potential complementary and integrative medicine treatments. Complementary and integrative medicine modalities that may improve chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment include mind-body techniques and acupuncture, as well as nutrition and herbal therapies. Studies on these modalities have not directly tested the hypothesis of modifying chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and were done on different disorders of memory loss and lack of concentration.

Short-term meditators (STM) (n=27) practiced Raja Yoga meditation for duration of six months to five years (mean duration 3.37±1.67 years) and long-term meditators (LTM) (n=73) practiced Raja Yoga meditation for more than five years (mean duration 11.19±5.13 years). The participants were asked to meditate and the physiological variables (HR, RR, SBP and DBP) were recorded twice (15 minutes and 30 minutes) after beginning of meditation. Also, the fasting blood sugar was estimated by glucometer. The study subjects did not differ significantly in age and various anthropometric characteristics such as body weight, body mass index, waist-hip ratio and fasting blood sugar. Comparison between STM and LTM showed that the changes from baseline values (from premeditation to post-meditation at 15 and 30 minutes) in LTM were not statistically significant with those in STM (P>0.05). However, within group differences in LTM revealed that changes in the physiological variables were statistically significant when compared between pre and post meditation both at 15 and 30 minutes. The study suggests that the long-term practice of Raja Yoga meditation improves basic cardio-respiratory functions due to shifting of the autonomic balance in favor of parasympathetic instead of sympathetic system.","Brahmakumaris Raja Yoga; Meditation","glucose; adult; age distribution; article; autonomic nervous system; body mass; body weight; breathing rate; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; female; glucose blood level; heart rate; human; male; parasympathetic function; physiology; sympathetic function; systolic blood pressure; waist hip ratio; yoga; Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Respiration; Sympathetic Nervous System; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870994611

It is defined as bringing one's complete attention to the experiences occurring in the present moment in a nonjudgmental or accepting way. The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) was developed to assess individual differences in mindfulness states. The FFMQ is composed of five facets representing elements of mindfulness: non-reactivity to inner experience, non-judging, acting with awareness, describing, and observing. In the present study, we applied voxel-based morphometry to investigate the relationship between the brain structure and each facet as measured by the FFMQ. The results showed a positive association between the describing facet of mindfulness on the FFMQ and gray matter volume in the right anterior insula and the right amygdala.

This study was designed to assess sympathetic autonomic functional status of meditators of various age groups. Material and Methods: Three clinical tests, Isometric handgrip test,Cold pressor test and Valsalva Meneuver were studied in 25 meditators of age ranging from 25 to 75 years. The results were compared with those observed in 25 non-meditators of matching age and socio economic status. Observation and Results: The basal cardiac parameters viz heart rate and blood pressure were uniformly lower in meditators than non meditators in all age groups, more so in senior meditators. On performing isometric handgrip test, non-meditators developed significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate during gripping than that seen in meditators. In cold pressor test, as compared to non-meditators, mediators showed blunted increase in blood pressure along with returning of blood pressure to basal level earlier, which indicated presence of controlled sympathetic drive in meditators. In Valsalva maneuver the overshoot of BP was lower in meditators than in non meditators. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the regular practice of meditation initially blunted the sympathetic drive and later on developed control over sympathetic function of meditators.","Isometric handgrip dynamometry; Meditation cold pressor test; Valsalva maneuver meditators","adrenergic system; adult; age distribution; aged; article; cold pressor test; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; functional assessment; functional status; hand grip; heart rate; human; human experiment; male; meditation; normal human; social status; sympathetic tone; systolic blood pressure; Valsalva maneuver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866071457

In this paper the authors intend to inquire the issue of how to design appropriate and effective curriculum for training whirling-kung in order to help learners reduce the symptom of nauseating and conquer the fear of whirling. Through a process of action research, the authors draw up two cruxes of whirling: choiceless awareness and centering. The authors also summarize 10 effective curriculum design principles in whirling-kung training to help the learners reduce the nauseating symptom in whirling-kung training courses: (1) Provide training and practice on ""mind-body-scan meditation"" before training whirling-kung. (2) Arrange the practice of meditation immediately after whirling, which constitutes a Whirling- Meditation unit (abbr. as WM unit in this paper). (3) Increase the length of WM unit gradually. (4) Arrange several WM units in one session if needed. (5) The break between training sessions should not be too long in order to keep the warmth of training. (6) The number of training sessions should be long enough to have training effects. (7) Adjust every learner's length of WM unit according to the overload training principle. (8) Select appropriate place for training. (9) Select appropriate music for training. (10) Try to arrange the whirling practice at least one hour after the meals. © 2012.

Diet-focused interventions generally do not result in lasting reductions in weight. Behavioral interventions that increase awareness of eating cues and satiety have been postulated to result in healthier eating habits. We hypothesized that participation in a program called mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) would positively influence the eating behaviors and nutritional intake of participants through changes in emotional eating (EE), uncontrolled eating (UE), and type and quantity of food consumed. Forty-eight veterans at a large urban Veterans Administration medical center were assessed before MBSR, after MBSR, and 4 months later. For all participants (N = 48), MBSR participation was not associated with significant changes in EE or UE. In addition, there were no significant differences in the intake of energy, fat, sugar, fruit, or vegetables at either follow-up time point as compared with baseline. Enhanced mindfulness skills and reduced depressive symptoms were seen over time with medium to large effect sizes. Changes in mindfulness skills were significantly and negatively correlated with changes in EE and UE over time. Overall, there was no evidence that participation in MBSR was associated with beneficial changes in eating through reductions in disinhibited eating or significant changes in dietary intake. Randomized studies are needed to further define the relationship between mindfulness program participation and eating behaviors. © 2012.","Eating behavior; Food intake; Longitudinal studies; Meditation; Posttraumatic stress disorders; Veterans","adult; anxiety disorder; article; bipolar disorder; body mass; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; controlled study; depression; dietary intake; eating disorder; eating habit; effect size; emotion; ethnicity; female; Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; health program; human; longitudinal study; male; meditation; mindfulness based stress reduction; obesity; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; posttraumatic stress disorder; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; religion; Three Factor Eating Questionnaire; United States; veteran; Adult; Choice Behavior; Depression; Eating; Emotions; Energy Intake; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Food Habits; Food Preferences; Fruit; Humans; Intervention Studies; Interviews as Topic; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Obesity; Questionnaires; Stress, Psychological; United States; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863100815

In Japan, the Park-Sasaki method of speed-reading involves organized visual training while forming both a relaxed and concentrated state of mind, as in meditation. The present study examined relationships between reading speed, sentence comprehension, and eye movements while reading short Japanese novels. In addition to normal untrained readers, three middle-level trainees and one high-level expert on this method were included for the two case studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: In Study 1, three of 17 participants were middle-level trainees on the speed-reading method. Immediately after reading each story once on a computer monitor, participants answered true or false questions regarding the content of the novel. Eye movements while reading were recorded using an eye-tracking system. Results revealed higher reading speed and lower comprehension scores in the trainees than in the untrained participants. Furthermore, eye-tracking data by untrained participants revealed multiple correlations between reading speed, accuracy and eye-movement measures, with faster readers showing shorter fixation durations and larger saccades in X than slower readers. In Study 2, participants included a high-level expert and 14 untrained students. The expert showed higher reading speed and statistically comparable, although numerically lower, comprehension scores compared with the untrained participants. During test sessions this expert moved her eyes along a nearly straight horizontal line as a first pass, without moving her eyes over the whole sentence display as did the untrained students. Conclusions/Significance: In addition to revealing correlations between speed, comprehension and eye movements in reading Japanese contemporary novels by untrained readers, we describe cases of speed-reading trainees regarding relationships between these variables. The trainees overall tended to show poor performance influenced by the speed-accuracy trade-off, although this trade-off may be reduced in the case of at least one high-level expert. © 2012 Miyata et al.",,"accuracy; adult; article; comprehension; controlled study; correlation analysis; experimental design; eye fixation; eye tracking; female; human; human experiment; Japanese; male; normal human; questionnaire; reading; reading speed; saccadic eye movement; scoring system; student; task performance; Asian; clinical trial; eye movement; Japan; middle aged; physiology; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Comprehension; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Reading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860740796

Patients and Methods: A randomized, wait-listed, controlled trial was carried out in 229 women after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to the 8-week MBSR program or standard care. Profile of Mood States (POMS; primary outcome), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES) scales and the WHO five-item well-being questionnaire (WHO-5) evaluated mood, quality of life, and well-being at weeks 0, 8, and 12. For each outcome measure, a repeated-measures analysis of variance model, which incorporated week 0 measurements as a covariate, was used to compare treatment groups at 8 and 12 weeks. Results: There were statistically significant improvements in outcome in the experimental group compared with control group at both 8 and 12 weeks (except as indicated) for POMS total mood disturbance (and its subscales of anxiety, depression [8 weeks only], anger [12 weeks only], vigor, fatigue, and confusion [8 weeks only]), FACT-B, FACT-ES, (and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy subscales of physical, social [8 weeks only], emotional, and functional well-being), and WHO-5. Conclusion: MSBR improved mood, breast- and endocrine-related quality of life, and well-being more effectively than standard care in women with stage 0 to III breast cancer, and these results persisted at three months. To our knowledge, this study provided novel evidence that MBSR can help alleviate long-term emotional and physical adverse effects of medical treatments, including endocrine treatments.

UK clinical guidance on supportive care for patients with brain and central nervous system tumors was published in 2006 and relied on very limited evidence. The current article reviews literature from 2005 through 2011 on the psychosocial and supportive needs of patients with PMBT and their families or caregivers. Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Psychinfo, Cochrane, Scopus, ASSIA, and Sciencedirect. The search initially yielded 6220 articles, of which 60 were found to be eligible (1). Eleven qualitative and 49 quantitative studies are reviewed here and mapped onto the structure of the existing UK clinical guidance. Studies suggest rates of depression and anxiety up to 48 in patients and up to 40 in caregivers, with many unmet needs and dissatisfaction with health care provider communication and information. Cognitive deficits increase as the disease progresses, hampering communication and decision-making. A range of neurological and physical symptoms at the end of life need recognition. Some successful supportive and neuropsychological interventions are reported. Although the volume of available studies has increased since UK guidance, many remain observational in nature, with few trials of interventions. However, this review provides an up to date resource for clinicians involved with patients with PMBT, describing current knowledge on patients psychosocial needs, the type of care which has been found to be beneficial, and highlighting areas where more research needs to be done. © 2012 The Author(s).","brain tumors; cognition; high-grade glioma; psychological health; rehabilitation; supportive care","psychotropic agent; steroid; advanced practice nurse; anxiety disorder; aphasia; astrocytoma; brain tumor; cancer grading; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; caregiver burden; caregiver support; cognitive defect; cognitive rehabilitation; communication skill; daily life activity; depression; disease association; epilepsy; glioma; health care need; health literacy; homeopathy; human; malignant neoplastic disease; massage; medical information; meditation; mental performance; mental stress; occupational therapy; patient care; patient counseling; patient decision making; patient referral; primary malignant brain tumor; psychological well being; psychosocial care; psychotherapy; quality of life; review; speech therapy; spiritual healing; supportive care need; systematic review; terminal care; verbal memory; vitamin supplementation; Anxiety; Brain Neoplasms; Caregivers; Depression; Glioma; Humans; Palliative Care; Quality of Life",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859520796

Diet, physical activity, and stress reduction may affect tumor promotion and disease progression. Methods: A randomized trial of an intensive diet, physical activity, and meditation intervention was conducted in men with rising post-treatment PSA after definitive treatment for PrCA. Intention-to-treat methods were used to compare usual care to the intervention in 47 men with complete data. Signal detection methods were used to identify dietary factors associated with PSA change. Results: The intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on any demographic or disease-related factor. Although the intervention group experienced decreases of 39% in intakes of saturated fatty acid (SFA as percent of total calories) (. p<. 0.0001) and 12% in total energy intake (218. kcal/day, p<. 0.05)], no difference in PSA change was observed by intervention status. Signal detection methods indicated that in men increasing their consumption of fruit, 56% experienced no rise in PSA (vs. 29% in men who did not increase their fruit intake). Among men who increased fruit and fiber intakes, PSA increased in 83% of participants who also increased saturated fatty acid intake (vs. 44% in participants who decreased or maintained saturated fatty acid intake). Conclusion: Results are discussed in the context of conventional treatment strategies that were more aggressive when this study was being conducted in the mid-2000s. Positive health changes in a number of lifestyle parameters were observed with the intervention, and both increased fruit and reduced saturated fat intakes were associated with maintaining PSA levels in men with biochemically recurrent disease. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Diet; Physical activity; Prostate cancer; Stress reduction","fat; monounsaturated fatty acid; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; prostate specific antigen; saturated fatty acid; adult; aged; article; body mass; caloric intake; cancer radiotherapy; controlled study; diet; fat intake; fiber; food intake; fruit; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; physical activity; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; randomized controlled trial; stress management; vegetable; Diet; Exercise; Humans; Male; Meditation; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms; Stress, Psychological",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858793073

Yoga has been reported to control stress, to be beneficial in treating stress related disorders, improving autonomic functions, lower blood pressure, increase strength & flexibility of muscles, improve the sense of well being, slow ageing process, control breathing, reducing signs of oxidative stress & improving spiritual growth. Aims & Objective: The aim of present study was to investigate whether regular practice of Yoga for six months can reduce the cardiovascular hyper-reactivity induced by cold pressor test. Materials and methods: The study group comprised 75 healthy subjects of 25-45 years age group. Initially there were 27 hyper-reactors to cold pressor test. The hyper-reactivity of 22 volunteers converted to hypo-reactivity after the yoga therapy of six months (81.48%). Other parameters like basal blood pressure, rise in blood pressure, pulse rate and rate of respiration were also statistically significantly reduced (by using student 't' test) Results: Regular practice of yoga significantly reduces the cardiovascular hyper-reactivity in basal blood pressure, rise in blood pressure after one minute of cold stress, pulse rate, & rate of respiration, after six month of yoga practice. Conclusion: Regular practice of yoga for six months reduced the Cardiovascular hyper-reactivity to cold pressor test in subjects, who were hyper reactive to cold stress, possibly by inducing parasympathetic predominance and cortico-hypothalamo-medullary inhibition.","Cold pressor test; Meditation; Pranayama; Yoga","adult; article; blood pressure; breathing rate; cardiovascular function; cold pressor test; human; human experiment; male; meditation; normal human; pranayama; pulse rate; sphygmomanometer; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950174515

An understanding of the diverse ways that religion helps older person cope and grow in the face of multiple losses is necessary for both researchers and practitioners, because cognitive, affective, and relational aspects of spirituality are all part of the complex picture of this aspect of resiliency over the life span. Preferences related to gender, culture, and denomination are also crucial for understanding and encouraging this form of resiliency. Recent empirical work and theorizing have identifi ed, as examples of the multiple pathways to spiritual resiliency, meaning making over time; imaginative use of the arts; optimization of positive affect; the ability to reframe losses; mature and emotionally rich relationships with self, others, and the Divine; the ability to grieve and to forgive; and, most importantly, rootedness in a healthy spiritual community.

Since molecules such as IL-6 have pleiotropic effects, consequences are wide ranging. This short review summarizes the evidence showing how IL-6 elevations in the context of inflammatory disease affect the organism, with a focus on sleep-related symptoms and fatigue; and conversely, how alterations in sleep duration and quality stimulate increased concentrations of IL-6 in the circulation. Research showing that acute as well as chronic psychological stress also increase concentrations of IL-6 supports the notion of a close link between an organism's response to physiological and psychological perturbations. The findings summarized here further underscore the particular importance of IL-6 as a messenger molecule that connects peripheral regulatory processes with the CNS. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.","Fatigue; Interleukin-6; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sleep; Stress","etanercept; ferroportin; hepcidin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; noradrenalin; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adrenalectomy; adverse outcome; anemia; anger; anxiety; circadian rhythm; cross-sectional study; daytime somnolence; disease activity; DNA binding; fatigue; human; hypercortisolism; hypersomnia; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; insomnia; lowest income group; meditation; mental stress; meta analysis (topic); narcolepsy; nonhuman; parasomnia; physiological stress; rheumatoid arthritis; short survey; sleep; sleep apnea syndrome; sleep disorder; sleep quality; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; stress; treadmill exercise; yoga",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864106582

Spiritual life can be defined as the search for personal contact with the transcendent. Careful assessment of spiritual life can help to value its importance to cancer patients from the moment of their diagnosis. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study. Two hundred fifty-seven patients undergoing cancer treatment filled in the validated Italian version of the Systems of Belief Inventory (SBI-15R). Patients were also asked to attribute themselves to one of the following, mutually exclusive categories: believer and churchgoer, believer but no churchgoer, and non-believer. Results. Five patients did not report their religious stance and were therefore excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 252 patients, 49% declared to be believers and churchgoers, 43% believers but not churchgoers, and 8% non-believers. Of the 20 cancer patients who declared not to have a religious faith, 7 patients agreed with the statement that they felt certain that God exists in some form, and 4 had experienced peace of mind through prayer and meditation. Almost all of the patients who declared to have a religious faith and to be churchgoers explicitly affirmed to have been helped by prayer and meditation in coping with their illness. Among believer churchgoers, only 30% declared to seek out the religious or spiritual community when they needed help. Conclusions. A large proportion of cancer patients find themselves involved with the search for a personal contact with the transcendent, also beyond any specific religious affiliation. These spiritual issues may be important even when they are not expressed as participation in religious rituals or adherence to specific religious beliefs. On the other hand, participation in religious rituals often implies the need for a personal spiritual life, both through those rituals and beyond them, as through personal prayer and meditation. These results ask for more attention on the part of professionals towards spiritual resources among cancer patients. It might be appropriate to look systematically for these resources from the moment of the diagnosis, through the sensitive administration of an easy and valid assessment tool like the SBI-15R.","Cancer patients; Religion; Spiritual assessment; Spirituality","adult; article; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer therapy; clinical assessment tool; coping behavior; cross-sectional study; female; human; major clinical study; male; meditation; needs assessment; patient assessment; patient attitude; personal needs; religion; self report; spiritual care; spiritual healing; survival time; Systems of Belief Inventory; adaptive behavior; aged; caregiver; Italy; middle aged; neoplasm; patient; psychological aspect; questionnaire; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patients; Questionnaires; Religion; Religion and Medicine; Spirituality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863196027

This RCT consisting of 172 women, aged 20-65 with stage I or II breast cancer consisted of the 8-week MBSR, which was compared to a nutrition education program (NEP) and usual supportive care (UC). Follow-up was performed at three post-intervention points: 4 months, 1, and 2 years. Standardized, validated self-administered questionnaires were adopted to assess psychosocial variables. Statistical analysis included descriptive and regression analyses incorporating both intention-to-treat and post hoc multivariable approaches of the 163 women with complete data at baseline, those who were randomized to MBSR experienced a significant improvement in the primary measures of QOL and coping outcomes compared to the NEP, UC, or both, including the spirituality subscale of the FACT-B as well as dealing with illness scale increases in active behavioral coping and active cognitive coping. Secondary outcome improvements resulting in significant between-group contrasts favoring the MBSR group at 4 months included meaningfulness, depression, paranoid ideation, hostility, anxiety, unhappiness, and emotional control. Results tended to decline at 12 months and even more at 24 months, though at all times, they were as robust in women with lower expectation of effect as in those with higher expectation. The MBSR intervention appears to benefit psychosocial adjustment in cancer patients, over and above the effects of usual care or a credible control condition. The universality of effects across levels of expectation indicates a potential to utilize this stress reduction approach as complementary therapy in oncologic practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Breast cancer psychosocial intervention; Expectancy; Mindfulness-based stress reduction program; Psychosocial factors; Quality of life","adult; aged; anxiety; article; breast cancer; cancer staging; cancer therapy; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; depression; early cancer; female; follow up; health program; hostility; human; intention to treat analysis; major clinical study; mindfulness based stress reduction; outcome assessment; paranoia; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; stress management; therapy effect; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mind-Body Relations, Metaphysical; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Relaxation Therapy; Self Care; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856226950

Eighty adults (40 men, 40 women; mean age 26 years) who practiced meditation regularly and 57 healthy control adults (35 men, 22 women; mean age 26 years) participated. Plasma catecholamines (norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (DA)) concentrations were measured, and a modified form of the Stress Response Inventory was administered. The results were analyzed using two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with control and meditation subjects, gene polymorphism as factors, and meditation duration as the covariate. Two-way ANCOVA showed a significant interaction between control and meditation subjects, and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on DA/NE+DA/E (p = 0.042) and NE/E+NE/DA (p = 0.046) ratios. A significant interaction was found for control and meditation subjects with COMT Val158Met polymorphism and plasma NE concentrations (p = 0.009). Post hoc ANCOVA in the meditation group, adjusted for meditation duration, showed significantly higher plasma NE concentrations for COMT Met carriers than COMT Val/Val subjects (p = 0.025). Significant differences of stress levels were found between the control and meditation subjects in BDNF Val/Met (p < 0.001) and BDNF Met/Met (p = 0.003), whereas stress levels in the BDNF Val/Val genotype did not differ between the control and meditation groups.

Fatigue, pain, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea, depression and distress are among the most common symtoms. Fatigue was the most prevalent severe symptom, with more than half of the sample having experienced moderate-to-severe fatigue. The other severe symptoms sleep disturbance, pain, distress, and sadness were present in two-thirds of the patients. Cancer patients often experience multiple symptoms, and it has been reported that cancer patients were experience an average of 11-13 concurrent symptoms. Symptoms may be a result of the disease itself or of the associated treatment. They may considerably affect the patient's sense of wellbeing and his or her physical and social functions. A higher number of symptoms were associated with lower quality of life and increased anxious and depressed. The influence of cancer on long-term health outcomes, specifically, individuals with a history of cancer have been shown to have greater loss of productivity, be less able to work, have poorer health status, and have greater need for assistance with activities of daily living than those without a history of cancer. Cancer survivors were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with lung or heart disease, arthritis, or diabetes; were more likely to experience frequent pain and urinary incontinence; and were more likely to have limitations in their daily activities. The control of symptoms is dependent on a comprehensive clinical assessment. Studies demonstrate a significant correlation among pain, depression, fatigue, and other symptoms commonly seen throughout the course of cancer. Therefore, multidimensional scales incorporating the most common symptoms would ensure systematic assessment. Currently available instruments that measure symptom clusters include the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, the Symptom Distress Scale, and others. Each of these tools has demonstrated utility in measuring symptom severity and quality of life. Value of symptom assessment is important. Interference ratings for multiple symptoms would help categorize levels of symptom distress. Assessment is essential to the prevention and management of symptoms common in people with cancer. Symptom research promotes evidence-based symptom management. Six complementary and alternative medicine therapies, used to control symptoms, were assessed, including herbs, tea, acupuncture, massage, meditation, and prayer. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use was greatest for difficulty breathing and pain, with prayer the most commonly used CAM for all symptoms. Some of the causal forces explaining the variations in, and relationships among, palliative care patients' symptoms changed over the final month of life. This illustrates how investigating the causal foundations of symptom correlation or clustering can provide more detailed understandings that may contribute to improved control of patient comfort, quality of life, and quality of death. Six major barriers to symptom management were identified: communication issues with the healthcare provider, medication concerns, difficult symptom management, lack of resources, physical or psychological distress, and fear of diagnostic or surgical procedures. The most common barrier to symptom management was communication issues with the healthcare provider. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Rajyoga is one of the techniques of meditation where a flow of thoughts is encouraged thus using mind in a natural way. Meditation has a number of positive effects on the physiology of human body. It has shown to reduce diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and serum cholesterol levels thus reducing the risk of coronary artery disease. Aims and Objectives: This study aims to highlight haemodynamic effects of meditation by studying its impact on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 100 healthy subjects (50 meditators and 50 non-meditators) from Brahma Kumari Ashram. They were further subgrouped on the basis of their sex, age and duration for which they had been practicing yoga. A detailed history was taken and detailed general physical examination was conducted on all of them. Anthropometric measurements were taken. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate and ECG was recorded in all of them. Data was collected and statistically analyzed to achieve the results. Results: The mean heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate were significantly lower in subjects who practised meditation regularly than in subjects who did not. ECG did not show any significant change except for decreased heart rate in meditators. Conclusions: Coronary Heart Disease remains one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in Indian population. Yoga and Meditation, given its positive effects on physiology of human body,if practised regularly, can emerge as one of the important non-pharmacological method of prevention of heart disease.","Coronary artery disease; Meditation; Prevention; Regular practise; Yoga","adult; age; anthropometry; article; blood pressure; body height; body weight; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiogram; female; gender; heart hemodynamics; heart rate; human; human experiment; lifestyle; male; normal human; physical examination; rajyoga meditation; systolic blood pressure; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84856171905

It was hypothesized that alcohol dependent inpatients with comparatively high levels of trait mindfulness would exhibit significant autonomic recovery from stress-primed alcohol cues mediated by greater attentional disengagement from such cues. Fifty-eight alcohol dependent inpatients participated in affect-modulated psychophysiological cue-reactivity protocol and a spatial cueing task designed to assess alcohol attentional bias (AB). Associations between trait mindfulness, alcohol AB, and an index of autonomic activity, high-frequency heart rate variability (HFHRV), were examined via multivariate path analysis. Higher trait mindfulness was significantly associated with less difficulty resisting the urge to drink and greater HFHRV recovery from stress-primed alcohol cues. After statistically controlling for the correlation of mindfulness and perceived difficulty resisting drinking urges, the association between mindfulness and HFHRV recovery was partially mediated by attentional disengagement from alcohol cues (model R2 =.30). Alcohol dependent inpatients higher in mindfulness are better able to disengage attention from alcohol cues, which in turn predicts the degree of HFHRV recovery from such cues. Trait mindfulness may index cognitive control over appetitive responses reflected in superior attentional and autonomic regulation of stressprimed alcohol cue-reactivity. © 2011 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies.","Addiction; Attentional bias; Heart rate variability; Mindfulness; Stress","alcohol; adult; affect; alcoholism; article; association; attention; autonomic nervous system; cognition; drinking behavior; female; heart rate variability; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; psychophysiology; regulatory mechanism; stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82155192310

Therefore, the concurrent use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with advanced malignancies seen in a dedicated phase 1 clinic was evaluated. METHODS: An investigator-designed survey was anonymously completed by patients seen in the phase 1 clinic. Pharmacologic CAM included any oral, topical, or intravenous agent, including vitamins, dietary supplements, and herbal products. Nonpharmacologic CAM included prayer, meditation, hypnosis, massage, and acupuncture. RESULTS: Of the 404 patients approached about completing the CAM survey, 394 (98%) agreed to respond, and 309 (78%) surveys were returned. Of those 309 patients, 162 (52%) used 1 or more CAM. Of the 162 CAM users, 77% utilized pharmacologic CAM, 71% used nonpharmacologic CAM, and 48% used both modalities. The most frequent CAM used were vitamins (70%), prayer (57%), and herbal products (26%). CAM utilization was not significantly associated with race, age, level of education, employment, or income level but was used more by women than men (P <.01). There was no statistically significant association between the use of CAM and quality of life as perceived by patients. Of the CAM users, 43% of patients had been using CAM for >5 years. Only 5% reported having side effects from using CAM, whereas 23% did not fully disclose their CAM use to their physicians. CONCLUSIONS: CAM usage is common in patients with advanced malignancies seen in a phase 1 clinic.

Meditation differs from other types of passive rest such as relaxation and sleep because it requires full consciousness and mindfulness of targets such as one's breathing. Forty-eight university students without meditation experience were recruited to learn a simple meditation technique. They were given a list of 10 insight problems to solve (the pre-test session). In this study, we focused on the unsolved problems and examined if they could be successfully solved after a 20 min rest interval with or without meditation. Results showed that relative to the control group that listened to Chinese or English words and made a language judgment, the groups who learned meditation successfully solved significantly more failed problems from the pre-test session, providing direct evidence for the role of meditation in promoting insight. Further analysis showed that maintaining a mindful and alert state during meditation (raising a hand to report every 10 deep breaths compared to every 100 deep breaths) resulted in more insight regarding the failed items from the pre-test session. This implies that it was watchfulness in meditation, rather than relaxation, that actually contributed to insight. Consistently, in the meditation session or control task, the percentage of alpha waves-a brain index of mental relaxation-was negatively correlated with insight. These results suggest a meditation-based insight-promoting mechanism different from that involved in passive rest such as relaxation and sleep. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","insight; meditation; problem solving","adult; article; breathing; electroencephalography; female; human; male; meditation; problem solving; Adult; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Meditation; Problem Solving; Respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80155177763

This study is aimed at evaluating the physiological effects of short-term mindfulness meditation in university students intending to take a written term examination. Young healthy university students (n=18) recruited as participants were divided equally into a meditation group without examination stress, a non-meditating group with examination stress, and a meditation group with examination stress. The meditation intervention groups were offered mindfulness practice twice daily of 1 h each time for a period of 5 weekdays, except for weekends, for 3 consecutive weeks. The parameters measured included heart rate, blood pressure and serum cortisol. Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were also obtained to monitor any negative psychological symptoms. All parameters were measured before intervention, just after intervention, which also coincided with the eve of the academic examination and at 3 weeks after. The DASS-Stress scale was significantly (p<0.05) reduced after intervention in the meditation group with no examination challenge. However, no significant changes were found in the cardiovascular and cortisol outcomes amongst all groups for all time lines. Even though these findings did not show any significant physiological responses to the short-term mindfulness practice in stressful conditions, nonetheless, the results demonstrate the potential benefits of this practice in alleviating stress in the neutral environment of university students. Future studies should address the effects of mindfulness practice in larger groups exposed in stressful situations.","Mindfulness meditation; Physiological effects; University examination stress","hydrocortisone; adult; article; awareness; blood pressure measurement; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart rate; human; human experiment; hydrocortisone blood level; male; meditation; mental stress; normal human; outcome assessment; psychological rating scale; psychophysiology; stress management; symptom; systolic blood pressure; university student",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051498214

Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, United States","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by chronic hyperandrogenic anovulation leading to symptoms of hirsutism, acne, irregular menses, and infertility. Multiple metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with PCOS, including insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, and subclinical atherosclerosis. However, current treatments for PCOS are only moderately effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications. This article describes how the physiological effects of major complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments could reduce the severity of PCOS and its complications. Acupuncture reduces hyperandrogenism and improves menstrual frequency in PCOS. Acupuncture's clinical effects are mediated via activation of somatic afferent nerves innervating the skin and muscle, which, via modulation of the activity in the somatic and autonomic nervous system, may modulate endocrine and metabolic functions in PCOS. Chinese herbal medicines and dietary supplements may also exert beneficial physiological effects in PCOS, but there is minimal evidence that these CAM treatments are safe and effective. Mindfulness has not been investigated in PCOS, but it has been shown to reduce psychological distress and exert positive effects on the central and autonomic nervous systems, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and immune system, leading to reductions in blood pressure, glucose, and inflammation. In conclusion, CAM treatments may have beneficial endocrine, cardiometabolic, and reproductive effects in PCOS. However, most studies of CAM treatments for PCOS are small, nonrandomized, or uncontrolled. Future well-designed studies are needed to further evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and mechanisms of CAM treatments for PCOS. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.","Acupuncture; Dietary supplements; Herbs; Mindfulness meditation; Traditional chinese medicine","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; androgen; Angelica root; berberine; beta endorphin; calcium; cinnamon extract; clomifene; colecalciferol; cyanocobalamin; docosahexaenoic acid; epigallocatechin gallate; exendin 4; folic acid; glucose; gonadotropin; green tea extract; herbaceous agent; icosapentaenoic acid; linoleic acid; luteinizing hormone; metformin; omega 3 fatty acid; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha; placebo; sirtuin 1; vitamin D; acupuncture; adrenergic system; alternative medicine; androgen synthesis; antioxidant activity; autonomic innervation; blood pressure regulation; central nervous system; Chinese medicine; clinical effectiveness; clinical evaluation; competitive inhibition; disease exacerbation; disease severity; distress syndrome; drug efficacy; drug safety; energy expenditure; fluid retention; flushing; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose transport; herb drug interaction; Herba lycopi; human; hyperandrogenism; hypertension; hypoglycemia; hypokalemia; hypophysis function; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; kidney disease; liver cancer; medicinal plant; meditation; menstrual cycle; metabolic syndrome X; mindfulness based stress reduction; nausea; nervousness; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; ovary polycystic disease; paresthesia; patient safety; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical medicine; priority journal; psychotherapy; qi gong; quality of life; Radix glycytthizae; Radix paeoniae; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory failure; review; Rhizoma alismatis; Rhizoma coptidis; rhizome; risk benefit analysis; Salvia miltiorrhiza; sensory nerve; sensory nerve cell; sensory stimulation; side effect; single drug dose; sleep disorder; steroidogenesis; Tai Chi; tea; therapy effect; thyroid disease; uterus contraction; vitamin supplementation; vomiting; xerostomia; Acupuncture Therapy; Animals; Complementary Therapies; Diet Therapy; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Meditation; Models, Biological; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959583032

This clinical condition still represents an important health problem and is associated with high mortality. Its natural history mandates surgical intervention when exceeding 55 mm in diameter and involving the ascending portion of the aorta (Type A), on the bases of an anatomical classification dated back to 1965. An intriguing question rising is whether a dissection that overcomes that critic acute phase has still the indication to surgical intervention. Molecular analysis of chronic dissected aortic walls could help in understanding how morphology and structure are affected and whether tissue homeostasis is re-established. Thus, pursued by this consideration, we made a histological and immunohistochemical characterization of a chronic Type A dissection, reporting three major findings: endothelial cells line the aortic primitive lumen, as well as the 'false' one; walls of primitive and 'false' lumina are comparable in thickness; vascular layers in the 'false' lumen are made up of terminally differentiated cells.

However, neuroscientific research facilitates the transition from conceptualization to empiricism, allowing scientists to locate the underlying neural mechanisms behind this phenomenon. Binding the multiplicity of conscious modalities, including the sense of ownership over one's experiences, agency over actions and first-person perspective relating to memory, emotion, spatial and environmental awareness, involves a specific integrative mechanism. It is suggested that the predominant candidate for this faculty lies with synchronous firing between distal assemblies of neurones. However, each cell assembly relates to a specific cognitive capacity, the majority of which is circumstantially recruited as and when necessary, and remains transient in nature. The pervasive and underlying aspect of the conscious self comes from the sensation of ownership over phenomenal experience. This remains omnipresent during waking consciousness and can be correlated with activity within the medial prefrontal cortex. This paper reviews evidence from fMRI and PET data, along with investigations involving lesions, neurological dysfunction and meditation providing a map of cooperative neurological regions associated with the various categories of the conscious self. These regions have been located predominantly within the parietal and prefrontal cortices. © 2011 © The Author 2011.

Institute, Sacramento, CA, United States","Background: Telomerase activity is a predictor of long-term cellular viability, which decreases with chronic psychological distress (Epel et al., 2004). Buddhist traditions claim that meditation decreases psychological distress and promotes well-being (e.g., Dalai Lama and Cutler, 2009). Therefore, we investigated the effects of a 3-month meditation retreat on telomerase activity and two major contributors to the experience of stress: Perceived Control (associated with decreased stress) and Neuroticism (associated with increased subjective distress). We used mediation models to test whether changes in Perceived Control and Neuroticism explained meditation retreat effects on telomerase activity. In addition, we investigated whether two qualities developed by meditative practice, increased Mindfulness and Purpose in Life, accounted for retreat-related changes in the two stress-related variables and in telomerase activity. Methods: Retreat participants (n= 30) meditated for ∼6 h daily for 3 months and were compared with a wait-list control group (n= 30) matched for age, sex, body mass index, and prior meditation experience. Retreat participants received instruction in concentrative meditation techniques and complementary practices used to cultivate benevolent states of mind (Wallace, 2006). Psychological measures were assessed pre- and post-retreat. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were collected post-retreat for telomerase activity. Because there were clear, a priori hypotheses, 1-tailed significance criteria were used throughout. Results: Telomerase activity was significantly greater in retreat participants than in controls at the end of the retreat (p< 0.05). Increases in Perceived Control, decreases in Neuroticism, and increases in both Mindfulness and Purpose in Life were greater in the retreat group (p< 0.01). Mediation analyses indicated that the effect of the retreat on telomerase was mediated by increased Perceived Control and decreased Neuroticism. In turn, changes in Perceived Control and Neuroticism were both partially mediated by increased Mindfulness and Purpose in Life. Additionally, increases in Purpose in Life directly mediated the telomerase group difference, whereas increases in Mindfulness did not. Conclusions: This is the first study to link meditation and positive psychological change with telomerase activity. Although we did not measure baseline telomerase activity, the data suggest that increases in perceived control and decreases in negative affectivity contributed to an increase in telomerase activity, with implications for telomere length and immune cell longevity. Further, Purpose in Life is influenced by meditative practice and directly affects both perceived control and negative emotionality, affecting telomerase activity directly as well as indirectly. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Meditation; Neuroticism; Perceived control; Purpose in life; Stress; Telomerase","telomerase; adult; aged; article; cell viability; controlled study; distress syndrome; emotionality; enzyme activity; female; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; life; major clinical study; male; meditation; mental health; mental stress; neurosis; perception; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; personal experience; priority journal; therapy effect; treatment duration; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Female; Humans; Immune System; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Physical Education and Training; Stress, Psychological; Telomerase; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955565742

To examine whether meditative practice is associated with successful emotion regulation, we examined the neurophysiological correlates of cognitive reappraisal in practitioners of a yogic meditative technique and controls. Participants were presented aversive pictures and were asked to cognitively change their appraisal of the affective meaning of the pictures by coming up with an alternative more positive interpretation of each picture. We found reduced magnitude of Event-Related Potentials (P300 and early time intervals of the late positive potential, LPP) following cognitive reappraisal of aversive pictures in both groups. However, in the yogic group, reduced magnitude was sustained during the later intervals of the LPP, while it subsided in the control group. Moreover, reduced amplitude of the late LPP correlated positively with experience of the technique. Results suggest a relation between yogic meditative practice and sustained attenuation of emotional response following emotion regulation. Increased positive affect and familiarity with cognitive emotion regulation in the yogic group may explain this effect. Whether this is a direct causal effect of the practice or can be attributed to characteristics of the participants that preexisted the training needs further examination in a randomized longitudinal study. © 2011 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies.","Cognitive reappraisal; Emotion regulation; Event-related potentials; Meditation; Yogic breathing","article; cognition; controlled study; emotionality; event related potential; human; human experiment; meditation; mental task; neuromodulation; normal human; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955132521

We question whether it should encompass 'prayer' when prayer can be directed at improving health, the mechanism is unexplained and the practice based on personal beliefs. A review of studies on prayer for the alleviation of ill-health by the Cochrane collaboration suggested results remain equivocal. A local randomised blinded study of intercessory prayer in patients with cancer showed a significant improvement in assessments of spiritual and emotional wellbeing, despite small effects. Most studies of prayer use as a complementary and alternative medicine are from the United States where religious affiliation is reportedly high. Classifying prayer within complementary and alternative medicine domains varies by culture but is usually combined with mind/body therapies (ie. meditation), distorting patterns of use. Importantly, complementary and alternative medicine use is not commonly raised with patients' physicians despite such discussions having been shown to enhance communication. Physicians who describe themselves as 'spiritual', as opposed to 'religious', appear more likely to accept complementary and alternative medicine.

This review highlights attitudes towards complementary and alternative medicine, particularly for cancer patients. In general, the longer the time since a cancer diagnosis, the more likely it is that someone may use complementary and alternative medicine. In addition, women of a younger age with a higher education are more likely to use complementary and alternative medicine. Most commonly, complementary and alternative medicine is used to treat a range of physical and emotional problems relating to cancer, and only rarely as a means to cure the cancer itself. Dietary supplements, dietary changes and meditation are the most commonly used therapies. Many people perceive that these - and other complementary and alternative medicines - are beneficial for both physical and emotional reasons. However, not all people gain their desired outcomes from using complementary and alternative medicine. There are few reports of negative effects, but these are factors in some people not using or ceasing complementary and alternative medicine. Others do not use complementary and alternative medicines because of disbelief or due to concerns about complementary and alternative medicine benefits or safety. Doctors are not always consulted about complementary and alternative medicine use, but many people hope their doctors are supportive of it.",,"alternative medicine; cancer patient; diet supplementation; emotion; human; perception; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955054645

There is disagreement between CAM practitioners, researchers and clinical oncologists, as to how evidence concerning effects of CAM can and should be produced, and how the existing evidence should be interpreted. This represents a considerable challenge for oncologists; both in terms of patient needs for an informed dialogue regarding CAM, and because some types of CAM may interact with standard treatments. There is a need for insight into which kinds of CAM may work, for whom they work, what the possible effects and side-effects are, and in what ways such effects may come about. The present article presents a framework for evaluating effects of CAM by suggesting a taxonomy of different levels of evidence related to different types of research questions and discussing the relevance of different research methodologies for different types of effects. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Complementary and alternative medicine; Effects; Evaluation; Research methodology","antineoplastic agent; herbaceous agent; placebo; acupuncture; alternative medicine; article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer survival; clinical effectiveness; conceptual framework; evidence based medicine; exercise; health belief; homeopathy; human; malignant neoplastic disease; massage; medical research; meditation; methodology; patient care; patient safety; psychological well being; psychosocial care; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); social belief; spiritual healing; survival time; taxonomy; therapy effect; types of study; validation study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953704199

Results are promising. Two studies of yoga reported at the 2010 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) found it significantly improved sleep quality and fatigue.[2,3] A randomized, controlled multicenter trial[2] assessed a Yoga for Cancer Survivors program in 410 nonmetastatic-cancer survivors. Participants were randomized into standard-care monitoring or standard care plus yoga, which consisted of twice-weekly 57-minute sessions including pranayama (breathing exercises), 18 gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga asanas (postures), and meditation. Yoga intervention significantly improved sleep quality, fatigue, and QOL, while reducing sleep medication use.[2] In the second study, from Bangalore, India, 66 breast cancer survivors with metastatic disease were randomized to 12 weeks of yoga or supportive therapy. Compared with the supportive-therapy group, women randomized to yoga showed significant reductions in fatigue severity and interference, sleep parameters, and symptom distress. Also, there were significant reductions in salivary cortisol levels only in the yoga group. While emphasizing that larger randomized controlled trials are needed, the investigators concluded that the results ""offer preliminary support for stress reduction benefits of yoga intervention.""[3] Indeed, in studies of breast cancer patients and survivors, yoga improved mood and decreased stress levels,[4,5] and a separate study of breast cancer survivors found that a Yoga of Awareness program reduced the number of hot flashes, improved fatigue, and reduced joint pain, with benefits persisting up to 3 months.[6] Tibetan yoga, which incorporates controlled breathing, visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low-impact postures, improved sleep quality in patients with lymphoma.[7] Yoga also reduced stress, increased the sense of well-being, and promoted more restful sleep in newly diagnosed cancer patients and cancer survivors.[8] An 8-week mindfulness-based stress-reduction program involving relaxation, meditation, and gentle yoga significantly improved symptoms of stress and overall quality of life in breast and prostate cancer outpatients.[9] Conclusions from a meta-analysis of nine studies of yoga in cancer patients state that, although preliminary data on the effectiveness of yoga are encouraging, larger, controlled clinical trials are needed.[10].",,"asthma; breast cancer; cancer patient; cancer survivor; carpal tunnel syndrome; fatigue; human; hypertension; irritable colon; low back pain; migraine; multiple sclerosis; osteoarthritis; prostate cancer; quality of life; review; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958052639

This review examines the evidence from systematic reviews, RCTs and epidemiological studies of CAM in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Some evidence exists in favour of phytosterols and phytostanols for diminishing LDL and total cholesterol in postmenopausal women. Similarly, regular fiber intake is effective in reducing serum total cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women. Clinical evidence also exists on the effectiveness of vitamin K, a combination of calcium and vitamin D or a combination of walking with other weight-bearing exercise in reducing bone mineral density loss and the incidence of fractures in postmenopausal women. Black cohosh appears to be effective therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms, primarily hot flashes, in early menopause. Phytoestrogen extracts, including isoflavones and lignans, appear to have only minimal effect on hot flashes but have other positive health effects, e.g. on plasma lipid levels and bone loss. For other commonly used CAMs, e.g. probiotics, prebiotics, acupuncture, homeopathy and DHEA-S, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are scarce and the evidence is unconvincing. More and better RCTs testing the effectiveness of these treatments are needed. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Aging women; Alternative medicine; Climacteric symptoms; Complementary medicine; Menopausal symptoms; Menopause","alpha tocopherol; Angelica sinensis extract; ascorbic acid; calcium; cholesterol; Cimicifuga racemosa extract; Dioscorea villosa extract; Ginkgo biloba extract; ginseng extract; Humulus lupulus extract; Hypericum perforatum extract; isoflavone derivative; lignan derivative; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; magnesium; phytosterol; placebo; plant extract; prasterone; prebiotic agent; primrose oil; probiotic agent; retinol; unclassified drug; vitamin B complex; vitamin D; vitamin K group; zinc; acupuncture; alternative medicine; bone density; clinical trial; drug mechanism; exercise; fiber; homeopathy; hot flush; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypnosis; leisure; meditation; menopausal syndrome; menopause; moxibustion; osteolysis; reflexology; review; Tai Chi; yoga; female; Hot Flashes; hypercholesterolemia; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; phytotherapy; Complementary Therapies; Female; Hot Flashes; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Menopause; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Phytotherapy; Cimicifuga dahurica; Complementary Therapies; Female; Hot Flashes; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Menopause; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Phytotherapy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955656933

Since recent studies have suggested that mindfulness meditation may induce improvements in attentional processing, we have tested 20 expert mindfulness meditators in the attention network test. Their performance was compared to that of 20 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition to attentional network analyses, overall attentional processing was analysed by means of efficiency scores (i.e., accuracy controlled for reaction time). Better orienting and executive attention (reflected by smaller differences in either reaction time or error score, respectively) were observed in the mindfulness meditation group. Furthermore, extensive mindfulness meditation appeared to be related to a reduction of the fraction of errors for responses with the same reaction time. These results provide new insights into differences in attentional processing related to mindfulness meditation and suggest the possibility of increasing the efficiency in attentional processing by extensive mental training. © 2009 The Experimental Psychology Society.","Attention; Attention network test; Mental training; Mindfulness meditation","adult; article; attention; cognition; female; human; male; meditation; middle aged; reaction time; Adult; Attention; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Reaction Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952864800

Methods: To identify qualifying studies, we searched 10 scientific databases and scanned bibliographies of relevant review papers and all identified articles. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed systematically using predefined criteria. Results: Twenty-one papers representing 18 clinical trials from 6 countries met our inclusion criteria, including 12 randomized controlled trials (N = 719), 1 non-randomized controlled trial (N = 58), and 5 uncontrolled trials (N = 105). Interventions included yoga and/or meditation-based programs, tai chi, and other relaxation practices, including muscle relaxation and breath-based techniques, relaxation response training, and low-frequency sound-wave therapy. Eight of the nine studies of yoga, tai chi, and meditation-based programs reported improvement in overall menopausal and vasomotor symptoms; six of seven trials indicated improvement in mood and sleep with yoga-based programs, and four studies reported reduced musculoskeletal pain. Results from the remaining nine trials suggest that breath-based and other relaxation therapies also show promise for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms, although intergroup findings were mixed. Most studies reviewed suffered methodological or other limitations, complicating interpretation of findings. Conclusions: Collectively, findings of these studies suggest that yoga-based and certain other mind-body therapies may be beneficial for alleviating specific menopausal symptoms. However, the limitations characterizing most studies hinder interpretation of findings and preclude firm conclusions regarding efficacy. Additional large, methodologically sound trials are needed to determine the effects of specific mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms, examine long-term outcomes, and investigate underlying mechanisms. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This program runs on a PC/104 multiprocessor network which includes 8-core 32-bit microprocessors and analog circuit boards to support artificial neural networks, neural membrane substrate-receptor binding simulation, emotional responses and high-level behaviors. The author now moves the executive function i to a separate ARM-based processor board. A waveform generator integrated circuit was also added to create a synthetic EEG signal, whose frequency was varied by a voltage produced by the ARM processor board. The result is a facsimile of the resting state of the conscious brain, instantiated in its own CPU board, generating a simulated EEG, in which the full range of brain functions may be reactivated by voluntary means or by incoming sensory alert.

The study group consisted of five subjects, two women and three men, with at least two years of experience in the practice of the technique. Blood samples were taken at hourly intervals from 09:00h to 21:00h. The subjects practiced meditation for one hour between 12:00h and 13:00h. Cortisol and ACTH levels were measured using radioimmunoassay methods, whereas catecholamines concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Cortisol showed a normal rhythm, with values significantly higher in the morning than in the afternoon (p=0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test), with a non significant decline in the levels during the period of meditation. For ACTH, there were no diurnal variations (p= 0.4), but with elevated levels of the hormone after meditation. Catecholamines showed no significant differences between the morning and afternoon concentrations (p= 0.09 for NE, p= 0.08 for E). After the TM-Sidhi program their values declined, reaching the minimum level at 14:00h. The present study found patterns of the daytime secretion of ACTH and catecholamines in practitioners of the TM-Sidhi technique that were different from those normally described. After the period of meditation, there was an increase in the levels of the hypophyseal hormone to reach its maximum daytime concentration. This was associated with decreased plasma catecholamines levels. The technique of meditation seems to have a significant effect on the sympathetic-adrenal medullary system and the neuroendocrine axis.","ACTH; Catecholamines; Circadian rhythms; Cortisol; Neuroendocrine axis; Transcendental meditation; Yoga","adrenalin; catecholamine derivative; corticotropin; hydrocortisone; hypophysis hormone; noradrenalin; adrenal medulla; adrenergic system; adult; article; catecholamine blood level; catecholamine release; circadian rhythm; controlled study; corticotropin blood level; corticotropin release; female; hormone response; human; human experiment; hydrocortisone blood level; male; neuroendocrine system; normal human; reference value; transcendental meditation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956243136

For example, our group recently reported that the practice of compassion meditation was associated with reduced innate immune (plasma interleukin [IL]-6) and subjective distress responses to a standardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]). However, because we administered a TSST after, but not prior to, meditation training in our initial study, it remained possible that associations between practice time and TSST outcomes reflected the fact that participants with reduced stress responses prior to training were more able to practice compassion meditation, rather than that meditation practice reduced stress responses. To help resolve this ambiguity, we conducted the current study to evaluate whether innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to a TSST conducted prior to compassion meditation training in an independent sample of 32 medically health young adults would predict subsequent amount of meditation practice time during a compassion meditation training protocol identical to the one used in our first study. No associations were found between responses to a TSST administered prior to compassion meditation training and subsequent amount of meditation practice, whether practice time was considered as a continuous variable or whether meditators were divided into high and low practice time groups based on a median split of mean number of practice sessions per week. These findings contrast strikingly with our original study, in which high and low practice time meditators demonstrated marked differences in IL-6 and distress responses to a TSST administered after meditation training. In addition to providing the first published data regarding stress responsivity as a potential predictor of subsequent ability/willingness to practice meditation, the current study strengthens findings from our initial work by supporting the conclusion that in individuals who actively engage in practicing the technique, compassion meditation may represent a viable strategy for reducing potentially deleterious physiological and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Genes might be silenced through methylation, or their expression facilitated by acetylization. A further step occurred when behaviors and psychological states were noted to regulate the activity of genes. A body of evidence has now been accumulated that assesses the specific genes affected by behavioral influences such as nurturing, by lifestyle interventions such as meditation, by emotions, and by alleviating psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Comparisons of the relative lengths of telomeres in identical twins, who start life with identical genes, show that emotional stress can result in one twin having a cellular age that is as much as 10 years older by age 40. New studies in the field of energy psychology also indicate that these psychological and emotional stressors may be remediated much more rapidly than previously believed possible, and that behavioral and psychological influences regulate the genes responsible for inflammation, immune function, and cellular regeneration, among others. These advances provide fruitful new avenues for research into the epigenetic properties of simple behavioral and emotional skills such as meditation, the Relaxation Response, and Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), and point to the potential of these methods as potent anti-aging and medical interventions.","Aging; Behavior; EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques); Emotions; Epigenetics; Meditation; Relaxation Response; Stress","Aging of materials; Alkylation; Gene expression; Genes; Mobile security; Stresses; Behavior; EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques); Emotions; Epigenetics; Meditation; Relaxation Response; Behavioral research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923303862

Regular exercise, a reduction in environmental toxins/pollutants, and stress reduction with prayer, meditation, and spirituality have all been shown to promote health and disease prevention. Through the activation of intracellular transduction molecules improved lifestyle activities can induce epigenetic factors on a cellular level to modulate inflammation, apoptosis and directly impact DNA stability to mitigate the risk of cancer development. Natural dietary compounds and supplements can also work as epigenetic activators to promote health and reduce cancer risk. We now call this science nutrigenomics. However for centuries and even millennia, although unaware of the science behind it, people have utilized specific phytonutrients from their environment for therapeutic purposes.

However, in the early 1900's the Flexner report noted that there was no place for religion in medicine; that medicine was strictly a scientific field, not a theological or philosophical one. In the mid to the latter 1900's there were several lay movements that started emphasized the importance of religion, spirituality and medicine. Lay religious movements found spiritual practices and beliefs to be important in how people cope with suffering and find inner healing even in the midst of incurable illness. The rise of Complementary and Alternative Medicine as well as the Hospice movements also influenced attention on the spiritual aspect of medicine. The Hospice movement, founded by Dr. Cecily Saunders, described the concept of ""total pain""--- i.e. the biopsychosocial and spiritual aspects of pain and suffering. Since the 1960's there has been increased research done in the area of religion and health and spirituality and health. Most of the studies are association studies which demonstrate and association of religious or spiritual beliefs and practices and some healthcare outcomes. More recently, studies on meditation have demonstrated significant improvement in health care outcomes and suggest meditation as a therapeutic modality. There are also numerous surveys that demonstrate patient need for having spirituality integrated into their care. Finally, a recent study demonstrated that patients with advanced illness who have spiritual care have better quality of life, increased utilization of hospice and less aggressive care at the end of life. In spite of all these studies, we still do not have a biological evidence base for mechanisms of beliefs and practices. There is considerable controversy over whether spirituality and religion can or even should be measured as criteria for integration into clinical care. Many believe that healthcare professionals have an ethical obligation to attend to all dimensions of a person's suffering, including the psychosocial as well as the spiritual and that ethical obligation is sufficient to require integration of spirituality into clinical care. Over the last twenty years, there has been an increase in the number of required courses in spirituality and medicine in US medical schools giving rise to a new field of medicine. In February of 2009, a national consensus conference developed spiritual care guidelines for interprofessional clinical spiritual care. These guidelines as well as the educational advances, research and ethical principles have supported the newly developing field of spirituality and health.","Disclosure; Family; Prostate cancer; Secrecy; Shame; Stigma","hospice; hospice care; human; quality of life; questionnaire; religion; Hospice Care; Hospices; Humans; Quality of Life; Religion; Spirituality; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886364856

Methods A systematic review following accepted international guidelines was conducted. Randomized controlled trials that compared biofeedback procedures with antihypertensive medication, placebo (sham biofeedback treatment), no intervention or other behavioural treatments were included. The outcome measure was change in blood pressure. Results The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 36 trials. Twenty-one trials employed biofeedback treatment with no adjunctive therapy, whereas 15 others used biofeedback treatment alongside another treatment. The majority of trials were small with no posttreatment follow-up or follow-up of less than 6 months. Qualitative heterogeneity of the included studies (e.g. poor quality of the trials, differences in interventions and inconsistencies in the measurement of outcomes) meant that it was inappropriate to pool data in the form of a meta-analysis. A narrative summary of the data based on trial authors' conclusions is presented. No studies reported long-term (>12 months) follow-up of patients. Data were grouped first by treatment type and then by comparator. Trial results were variable and conflicting, demonstrating no clear benefits of biofeedback in relation to moderation of hypertension. Conclusion Although there may be other reported life benefits to its use, we found no convincing evidence that consistently demonstrates the effectiveness of the use of any particular biofeedback treatment in the control of essential hypertension when compared with pharmacotherapy, placebo, no intervention or other behavioural therapies. Any future research needs to be conducted using accepted quality standards and given current guidelines for the treatment of hypertension is likely to be considered only as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Biofeedback; Essential hypertension; Systematic review","antihypertensive agent; placebo; autogenic training; behavior therapy; essential hypertension; feedback system; follow up; human; hypnosis; meditation; meta analysis (topic); practice guideline; priority journal; qualitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; sham procedure; stress management; systematic review; treatment duration; treatment outcome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650786652

The evaluation instruments used were the SCL-90-R Questionnaire and the Caregiver Overload Scale. Results: The statistical analyses done show a significant reduction in the three general indices and in the various dimensions of psychological discomfort, as well as in the caregiver overload variable in the experimental group compared to the control group at the end of the intervention. However, the improvements found in the experimental group were lower in the follow-up evaluation done four months after intervention, with significantly higher scores than in post-test in all the dimensions. Conclusions: These results are in agreement with other studies in which it was found that intervention for Alzheimer caregivers is effective in the short term, but the effect becomes diluted over time, so measurements and policies for these caregivers have to enable the beneficial effects of intervention reducing psychological discomfort and overload to be maintained. © 2009 SEGG.","Alzheimer; Caregivers; Conciencia Mindfulness; Intervention","Alzheimer disease; article; caregiver; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; follow up; health program; human; meditation; mental disease; pretest posttest design; psychological discomfort; rating scale; scoring system; structured questionnaire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957362118

Earlier studies have shown that meditation practices help to organize sleep-wake behavior. In the present study, we evaluated the sleep architecture of vipassana meditators across different age groups. Whole-night polysomnography was carried out in healthy male subjects between 30 and 60 years of age from control (.n= 46) and meditation (.n= 45) groups. They were further divided into younger- (30-39 years), middle- (40-49 years), and older-aged (50-60 years) groups. Sleep variables were evaluated from subjects who had a sleep efficiency index more than 85%. The sleep architecture of vipassana meditators was different from that of control groups. Vipassana meditators showed enhanced slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep states with an enhanced number of sleep cycles across all age groups. When compared to meditators, the control groups exhibited pronounced age-associated decrease in slow wave sleep states.

To sustain it and even grow with it biology invented different mechanisms, since stress resistance is obligatory. These pathways, we surmise, can be activated and learned intentionally, through professional stress management training or 'mind-body medicine', or endogenously and automatically through autoregulation. Since the primary goal of various stress-reducing approaches is corresponding, we expect to find an overlapping physiology and neurobiological principle of stress reduction. These common pathways, as we speculate, involve some of the very same signalling molecules and structures. METHODS: Concepts of stress and stress management are described and then associated with underlying molecular and neurobiological pathways. Evidence is gathered from different sources to substantiate the hypothesis of an overlapping neurobiological principle in stress autoregulation. RESULTS: Stress describes the capacity and mechanisms to sustain and adjust to externally or internally challenging situations. Therefore, organisms can rely on the endogenous ability to self-regulate stress and stressors, i.e., autoregulatory stress management. Stress management usually consists of one to all of the following instruments and activities: behavioral or cognitive, exercise, relaxation and nutritional or food interventions (BERN), including social support and spirituality. These columns can be analyzed for their underlying neurobiological and autoregulatory pathways, thereby revealing a close connection to the brain's pleasure, reward and motivation circuits that are particularly bound to limbic structures and to endogenous dopamine, morphine, and nitric oxide (NO) signalling. Within this work, we demonstrate the existence of opioid, opiate, dopamine and related pathways for each of the selected stress management columns. DISCUSSION: Stress management techniques may possess specific and distinct physiological effects. However, beneficial behaviors and strategies to overcome stress are, as a more general principle, neurobiologically rewarded by pleasure induction, yet positively and physiologically amplified and reinforced, and this seems to work via dopamine, endorphin and morphine release, apart from other messenger molecules. These latter effects are unspecific, however, down-regulatory and clearly stress-reducing by their nature. CONCLUSIONS: There seems to exist a common neurobiological mechanism, i.e., limbic autoregulation, that involves dopamine, morphine and other endogenous signalling molecules, e.g., other opioid receptor agonists, endocannabinoids, oxytocin or serotonin, many of which act via NO release, and this share seems to be of critical importance for the self-regulation and management of stress: stress management is an endogenous potential. © 2010 Neuroendocrinology Letters.","Autoregulation; Behavior; Brain; Dopamine; Exercise; Meditation; Mind-body medicine; Morphine; Nitric oxide; Nutrition; Opioids; Oxytocin; Pleasure; Relaxation; Reward; Stress","brain derived neurotrophic factor; catecholamine; dopamine; endocannabinoid; endorphin; hydrocortisone; intermedin; melatonin; morphine; nitric oxide; noradrenalin; opiate; opiate receptor; oxytocin; serotonin; vasopressin; adaptation; adrenergic system; alertness; allostasis; autoregulation; behavior; brain; cognition; cognitive therapy; environmental factor; exercise; food intake; homeostasis; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; leisure; memory; mental health; motivation; neurobiology; nociceptive stimulation; nonhuman; nutrition; reaction analysis; religion; review; reward; signal transduction; social psychology; social support; stress management; wellbeing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77749339006

Method: This study is a secondary analysis of data obtained from a sub-sample of peri- and postmenopausal women (N = 212) from the TREMIN Research Program on Women's Health. Results: The hypothesized mediational model was tested using path analysis within a structural equation modeling framework in Mplus Version 5.1. In unadjusted analysis, the relationships between physical activity, menopausal hot flashes, and perceived stress were mediated by depressed mood; fatigue mediated the relationships between hot flashes, body mass index, and perceived stress. When adjusting for age, insomnia, menopausal and hormone use status, the mediational effects of depressed mood on stress remained significant only for physical activity, and fatigue mediated the relationship between hot flashes and stress. The adjusted model explained 70% of variance in perceived stress, 82% of variance in depressed mood, and 81% of variance in fatigue. Conclusion: Depressed mood may partially explain the relationship between physical activity and perceived stress in middle-aged women, however further studies are needed to corroborate causality. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Use of CAM since the time of diagnosis was assessed 12-16 weeks post-surgery for the 3343 women (age 18-70) included in the study (response rate: 68%). Socio-demographic and clinical variables were obtained from national longitudinal registries. Results: 40.1% of the women had used one or more types of CAM. Users were younger than non-users. Age adjusted analyses showed that CAM users were characterised by absence of comorbidity, higher educational level, higher personal income, higher social status, being divorced/separated and living in the metropolitan area of Copenhagen. Multivariate analyses revealed that chemotherapy was the only clinical and treatment-related predictor of CAM use, and that CAM users were more likely to be of normal weight and non-smokers. Of CAM users, 33.7% believed that CAM would have a positive influence upon their breast cancer. Different characteristics distinguished users of individual types of CAM. Conclusion: The results of this first nationwide study of utilisation of CAM in breast cancer show that CAM users are healthier and more likely to have higher socio-economic status than non-users. Different user patterns for individual types of CAM may be overlooked, when different types of CAM are treated as one homogeneous category. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the current article, the reports on pain modulation in the human brain were reviewed from higher cortical regulation, i.e. top-down effect, particularly studied in psychological determinants. Pain modulation can be examined by gene therapy, physical modulation, pharmacological modulation, psychological modulation, and pathophysiological modulation. In psychological modulation, this article examined (a) willed determination, (b) distraction, (c) placebo, (d) hypnosis, (e) meditation, (f) qi-gong, (g) belief, and (h) emotions, respectively, in the brain function for pain modulation. In each, the operational definition, cortical processing, neuroimaging, and pain modulation were systematically deliberated. However, not all studies had featured the brain modulation processing but rather demonstrated potential effects on human pain. In our own studies on the emotional modulation on human pain, we observed that emotions could be induced from music melodies or pictures perception for reduction of tonic human pain, mainly in potentiation of the posterior alpha EEG fields, likely resulted from underneath activities of precuneous in regulation of consciousness, including pain perception. To sum, higher brain functions become the leading edge research in all sciences. How to solve the information bit of thinking and feeling in the brain can be the greatest challenge of human intelligence. Application of higher cortical modulation of human pain and suffering can lead to the progress of social humanity and civilization. © 2009 Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Belief; Brain; Distraction; Emotions; Hypnosis; Meditation; Pain modulation; Placebo; Qi-gong; Will","anesthetic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate derivative; placebo; acupuncture; alpha rhythm; assay; brain cortex; brain function; breathing exercise; consciousness; dissociation; distractibility; electroencephalography; emotion; gene therapy; human; hypnosis; leisure; massage; meditation; music; nerve stimulation; neuroimaging; neuromodulation; nociception; pain; perception; psychological aspect; qi gong; short survey; sleep; suggestion; thinking; transcranial magnetic stimulation; transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation; Animals; Brain; Humans; Pain; Perception",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350638804

Comparable measures of impulsive and premeditated aggression have not been developed for populations with a severe mental disorder. A practical difficulty is that seriously disturbed, thought-disordered patients are incapable of providing reliable historical information. The investigators adapted the Barratt-Stanford instrument for differentiating impulsive from premeditated aggression so that instead of serving as an interview schedule, it could be used to assess aggression from previously documented written descriptions. The study found that the majority of ratable patients showed predominantly impulsive aggression, and after omitting four weak items, the inter-rater reliability for the determination of impulsive aggression was good (k = 0.53). Far fewer of the patients were determined to have shown predominantly premeditated aggression (from 14.2% to 15.5%) and the inter-rater reliability for premeditated aggression was deemed fair (k = 0.33). © 2009 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.","Episodic dyscontrol; Forensic science; Impulsive aggression; Inter-rater reliability; Intermittent explosive disorder; Mental illness; Premeditated aggression","adult; aggression; article; behavior disorder; clinical assessment; disease severity; human; impulsiveness; interview; major clinical study; male; meditation; mental disease; mood disorder; patient information; priority journal; psychosis; rating scale; reliability; schizophrenia; thought disorder; violence; Adolescent; Adult; Aggression; Forensic Psychiatry; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Male; Mental Disorders; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index; Violence; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350502034

In the 5 years before diagnosis, CAM therapies used at least weekly by >20% of women included green tea, glucosamine, omega-3 fatty acids, prayer and religion. CAM use was high (86.1% of participants) in the period immediately following diagnosis; 47.5% used botanical supplements, 47.2% used other natural products, 28.8% used special diets, 64.2% used mind-body healing, and 26.5% used body/energy/other treatments. In multivariable analyses, frequent use of each CAM modality before and after diagnosis was associated with use of other CAM modalities and other health behaviors (i.e., high fruit/vegetable intake, lower BMI). CAM use before and after BC diagnosis is common in this diverse group of women. Our results emphasize the need for clinicians to discuss CAM use with all BC patients. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Breast cancer; Cohort study; Complementary and alternative medicine; Epidemiology","antineoplastic agent; chamomile; chondroitin; Cimicifuga racemosa extract; cranberry extract; Echinacea extract; garlic extract; ginger extract; ginseng extract; glucosamine; green tea extract; linseed oil; melatonin; natural product; omega 3 fatty acid; ubidecarenone; Viscum album extract; acupressure; acupuncture; adult; African American; aged; alternative medicine; aromatherapy; article; Asian; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer hormone therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; female; fiber; guided imagery; health behavior; Hispanic; human; hypnosis; interview; low carbohydrate diet; low fat diet; major clinical study; massage; mastectomy; meditation; partial mastectomy; priority journal; prospective study; protein diet; religion; yoga; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349572506

Further, these stress-related factors play major roles in inflammation, acting as barriers to wound healing and tissue regeneration. Fractures, denervation, tendon and ligament rupture, and cartilage degradation are morbidities associated with injury and often act as an impediment for healing. Studies of human fingertip regeneration exist; however, the underlying molecular and environmental changes have yet to be completely elucidated. Studying the regenerative capabilities of lower organisms and fetal wound healing has allowed scientists to understand the mechanisms behind regeneration, coming closer to a human application. Much research relies on the idea that the developing embryo shares a great deal in common with regenerating appendages of organisms such as the salamander. This review will cover historical perspectives of regeneration biology and current topics in limb regeneration, with particular interest given to the upper extremity, including the commonalities between human embryological development and amphibian regeneration, growth factors and pathways that show correlation with development and regeneration, recently discovered differences in fetal and adult wound healing, and current research and knowledge regarding human extremity tissue regeneration.

While the mechanisms remain investigational, studies show that meditation may affect multiple pathways that could play a role in brain aging and mental fitness. For example, meditation may reduce stress-induced cortisol secretion and this could have neuroprotective effects potentially via elevating levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Meditation may also potentially have beneficial effects on lipid profiles and lower oxidative stress, both of which could in turn reduce the risk for cerebrovascular disease and age-related neurodegeneration. Further, meditation may potentially strengthen neuronal circuits and enhance cognitive reserve capacity. These are the theoretical bases for how meditation might enhance longevity and optimal health. Evidence to support a neuroprotective effect comes from cognitive, electroencephalogram (EEG), and structural neuroimaging studies. In one cross-sectional study, meditation practitioners were found to have a lower age-related decline in thickness of specific cortical regions. However, the enthusiasm must be balanced by the inconsistency and preliminary nature of existing studies as well as the fact that meditation comprises a heterogeneous group of practices. Key future challenges include the isolation of a potential common element in the different meditation modalities, replication of existing findings in larger randomized trials, determining the correct ""dose,"" studying whether findings from expert practitioners are generalizable to a wider population, and better control of the confounding genetic, dietary and lifestyle influences. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Cognition; Cortisol; Dementia; Meditation; Stress","brain derived neurotrophic factor; hydrocortisone; influenza vaccine; lipid; melatonin; serotonin; virus antibody; aging; antibody titer; antioxidant activity; arousal; brain atrophy; brain cortex; brain function; brain size; cerebrovascular disease; clinical trial; cognition; conference paper; cortical synchronization; dementia; depression; diet; electroencephalography; emotion; emotional stability; hemisphere; heredity; human; hydrocortisone release; hydrocortisone urine level; intelligence; lifestyle; longevity; meditation; mental performance; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; nerve degeneration; neuroanatomy; neurophysiology; neuropsychological test; oscillation; oxidative stress; prefrontal cortex; risk reduction; stress; stroke; transcendental meditation; visual cortex; yoga",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549130833

Telomeres may provide a pathway for exploring this question. Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. The length of telomeres offers insight into mitotic cell and possibly organismal longevity. Telomere length has now been linked to chronic stress exposure and depression. This raises the question of mechanism: How might cellular aging be modulated by psychological functioning? We consider two psychological processes or states that are in opposition to one another-threat cognition and mindfulness-and their effects on cellular aging. Psychological stress cognitions, particularly appraisals of threat and ruminative thoughts, can lead to prolonged states of reactivity. In contrast, mindfulness meditation techniques appear to shift cognitive appraisals from threat to challenge, decrease ruminative thought, and reduce stress arousal. Mindfulness may also directly increase positive arousal states. We review data linking telomere length to cognitive stress and stress arousal and present new data linking cognitive appraisal to telomere length. Given the pattern of associations revealed so far, we propose that some forms of meditation may have salutary effects on telomere length by reducing cognitive stress and stress arousal and increasing positive states of mind and hormonal factors that may promote telomere maintenance. Aspects of this model are currently being tested in ongoing trials of mindfulness meditation. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Appraisal; Meditation; Mindfulness; Rumination; Stress; Telomerase; Telomere length","telomerase; acute stress; arousal; ataxia telangiectasia; attention; cell aging; chronic stress; cognition; conference paper; coping behavior; death; disease association; emotion; health status; human; longevity; meditation; mental stress; molecular mechanics; molecular model; oxidative stress; progeria; senescence; tandem repeat; telomere; Werner syndrome",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549126291

While most work on behavior change emphasizes cognition and motivation, this review highlights stress-reactivity as a rate-limiting resistance to learning. Surveying cognitive-behavioral theories, it finds these limited in modeling stress-reactivity. Reviewing current interventions that address stress by integrating relaxation, mindfulness, imagery, or movement with cognitive-behavioral education, it attributes their limited effectiveness to the limits of their model of stress and their strategy of eclectically mixing techniques. Next, the article explores the Indic model of stress-cessation and self-healing assumed by mindfulness practice, concluding that it more fully reflects current findings on stress and learning. It reviews the theory and practice of mindfulness and of two less known contemplative ""vehicles"" preserved in Tibet, using more advanced techniques and insights better suited to lay lifestyles and secular cultures. It suggests that the Tibetan tradition of integrating all three vehicles of contemplative insight and skill in one self-healing practice should maximize coherence and effectiveness while minimizing confounding variables caused by eclecticism. Finally, the paper introduces an intervention that integrates mindfulness with techniques of cognitive analysis, affect modulation, motivational imagery, and reinforcing breathing, tailored over centuries into a complete, threefold path of self-healing. A pilot study of this intervention in women treated for breast and other gynecologic cancers suggests that the whole spectrum of Indo-Tibetan mind/body practices can be readily mastered and effectively used by Westerners to reduce stress and enhance learning and quality of life. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Contemplation; Health education; Imagery; Indo-Tibetan; Mindfulness; Self-healing","catecholamine; glucocorticoid; adaptation; adaptive behavior; addiction; affect; aggression; aging; allostasis; alternative medicine; anxiety; autonomic nervous system; behavior change; behavior therapy; breast cancer; breathing exercise; cancer therapy; catecholamine release; chronic stress; cognition; cognitive therapy; conference paper; coping behavior; death; defensive behavior; depression; distress syndrome; eclecticism; emotion; gynecologic cancer; healing; health behavior; human; hypnosis; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; imagery; learning; life satisfaction; life stress; meditation; motivation; nerve cell plasticity; perception; personality; physiological stress; placebo effect; posttraumatic stress disorder; preventive medicine; psychoanalysis; psychological model; psychotrauma; quality of life; reinforcement; relaxation training; self evaluation; social support; stress management; subclinical syndrome; Tibetan medicine; transcendental meditation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549122384

It reviews recent findings and offers a research framework. The review links the age-related biology of stress and regeneration to the variability of mind/brain function found under a range of conditions from trauma to enrichment. The framework maps this variation along a biphasic continuum from atrophic dysfunction to peak performance. It adopts the concept of allostatic load as a measure of the wear-and-tear caused by stress, and environmental enrichment as a measure of the use-dependent enhancement caused by positive reinforcement. It frames the dissociation, aversive affect and stereotyped reactions linked with stress as cognitive, affective and behavioral forms of allostatic drag; and the association, positive affect, and creative responses in enrichment as forms of allostatic lift. It views the human mind/brain as a heterarchy of higher intelligence systems that shift between a conservative, egocentric mode heightening self-preservation and memory and a generative, altruistic mode heightening self-correction and learning. Cultural practices like meditation and psychotherapy work by teaching the self-regulation of shifts from the conservative to the generative mode. This involves a systems shift from allostatic drag to allostatic lift, minimizing wear-and-tear and optimizing plasticity and learning. For cultural practices to speed research and application, a universal typology is needed. This framework includes a typology aligning current brain models of stress and learning with traditional Indo-Tibetan models of meditative stress-cessation and learning enrichment. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Imagery; Learning; Longevity; Meditation; Mindfulness; Psychotherapy","4 aminobutyric acid; arginine; dopamine; endorphin; melatonin; prasterone; vasopressin; adaptive behavior; affect; aging; alternative medicine; attention; autogenic training; aversive behavior; basal ganglion; behavior therapy; brain atrophy; brain blood flow; brain cortex; brain dysfunction; brain function; brain size; cognition; cognitive therapy; conference paper; creativity; depression; dissociation; ego psychology; electroencephalography; empathy; environmental enrichment; family therapy; guided imagery; healing; hemispheric dominance; human; hypnosis; intelligence; intimacy; learning; lifespan; lifestyle; meditation; mental disease; music; mysticism; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; nonhuman; perception; problem solving; psychoanalysis; psychoanalytic theory; psychotherapy; psychotrauma; quality of life; recognition; reinforcement; relaxation training; religion; reproduction; sex therapy; social learning; social stress; stress; survival; Tai Chi; transcendental meditation; working memory; yoga",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549121888

The body must be fortified before receiving stronger treatments for regeneration. All disease is brought into balance with understanding of the interplay of the five elements, three humors, and their qualities and locations. The example of multiple sclerosis (MS) is given. The macroscopic three-humor interpretation of MS agrees with the microscopic three-humor description of demyelination, providing a new framework for the understanding and treatment of MS. Treatments for MS and other chronic conditions are based on age, season, time of day, and the individual's three-humor and hot (excess) and cold (deficiency) balance. Treatments to promote regeneration include nutrition, gentle exercise, herbal formulas, accessory therapies such as herbal baths and oils, and meditation. It is built into the theory of Tibetan medicine to have predictions about outcome and distinguish different disease patterns in patients with MS and other disorders. Taking into account daily and seasonal variations coupled with the changing nature of MS, it is critical to frequently evaluate people with MS and other chronic conditions for monitoring and adjustment of treatment for regeneration. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Detoxification; Longevity; Multiple sclerosis; Nervous system; Neurological disorders; Regeneration; Tibetan medicine; Tonification","conference paper; demyelination; diet therapy; exercise; herbal medicine; human; immunity; meditation; multiple sclerosis; nutrition; nutritional assessment; regeneration; Tibetan medicine",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549108367

Should modern medicine dismiss them as unscientific, view them as sources of alternatives hidden in a matrix of superstition, or regard them as complementary sciences of medicine? We make the latter argument using the example of Tibetan medicine. Tibetan medicine is based on analytic models and methods that are rationally defined, internally coherent, and make testable predictions, meeting current definitions of ""science."" A ninth century synthesis of Indian, Chinese, Himalayan, and Greco-Persian traditions, Tibetan medicine is the most comprehensive form of Eurasian healthcare and the world's first integrative medicine.

Adapting the therapeutic philosophy and contemplative science of Indian Buddhism to the quality of secular life and death, it features the world's most effective systems of positive and palliative healthcare. Based on qualitative theories and intersubjective methods, it involves predictions and therapies shown to be more accurate and effective than those of modern medicine in fields from physiology and pharmacology to neuroscience, mind/body medicine, and positive health.

Western biomedical research has begun to demonstrate that the psychobiological states induced and cultivated by cognitive behavioral practices which are emblematic of those contained within the Indo-Tibetan tradition (hypnosis, meditation, visualization, systematic relaxation), indeed do have a profound impact on the body's protective and regulatory systems. Although continued study is necessary, much of the early research illuminating the mechanisms responsible for the life-span extending and health-enhancing effects of these cognitive behavioral practices points to the importance of their anti-inflammatory, anti-stress, and antioxidant effects as well as their impact in enhancing the production of endogenous substances that possess general longevity-enhancing, regenerative properties. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.","Meditation; Preventative health; Psychoneuroimmunology","aging; cognition; conference paper; health service; immune response; leisure; lifespan; longevity; medical research; neuroendocrine system; psychophysiology; stress",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-69549084713

While much attention has been paid to meditation practices that emphasize calming the mind, improving focused attention, or developing mindfulness, less is known about meditation practices that foster compassion. Accordingly, the current study examined the effect of compassion meditation on innate immune, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to psychosocial stress and evaluated the degree to which engagement in meditation practice influenced stress reactivity. Sixty-one healthy adults were randomized to 6 weeks of training in compassion meditation (n = 33) or participation in a health discussion control group (n = 28) followed by exposure to a standardized laboratory stressor (Trier social stress test [TSST]). Physiologic and behavioral responses to the TSST were determined by repeated assessments of plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 and cortisol as well as total distress scores on the Profile of Mood States (POMS). No main effect of group assignment on TSST responses was found for IL-6, cortisol or POMS scores. However, within the meditation group, increased meditation practice was correlated with decreased TSST-induced IL-6 (rp = -0.46, p = 0.008) and POMS distress scores (rp = -0.43, p = 0.014). Moreover, individuals with meditation practice times above the median exhibited lower TSST-induced IL-6 and POMS distress scores compared to individuals below the median, who did not differ from controls. These data suggest that engagement in compassion meditation may reduce stress-induced immune and behavioral responses, although future studies are required to determine whether individuals who engage in compassion meditation techniques are more likely to exhibit reduced stress reactivity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of these techniques emphasized the skill of slow breathing (<0.15 Hz). This paper reports our study on HRV during meditation which emphasizes inward attention. Inward attention has been an important approach for the Zen-meditation practitioners to enter into transcendental consciousness. Two groups of subjects were investigated, 10 experimental subjects with Zen-meditation experience and 10 control subjects without any meditation experience. We analyzed HRV both in time and frequency domains. The results revealed both common and different effects on HRV between inward-attention meditation and normal rest. The major difference of effects between two groups were the decrease of LF/HF ratio and LF norm as well as the increase of HF norm, which suggested the benefit of a sympathovagal balance toward parasympathetic activity. Moreover, we observed regular oscillating rhythms of the heart rate when the LF/HF ratio was small under meditation. According to previous studies, regular oscillations of heart rate signal usually appeared in the low-frequency band of HRV under slow breathing. Our findings showed that such regular oscillations could also appear in the high-frequency band of HRV but with smaller amplitude.",,"adrenergic activity; adult; article; attention; breathing pattern; cholinergic activity; consciousness; controlled study; female; frequency modulation; heart muscle potential; heart rate variability; heart rhythm; human; human experiment; male; meditation; mental health; normal human; signal transduction; vagus nerve; breathing; cholinergic system; heart rate; physiology; Adult; Attention; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Meditation; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149355796

Modification in lipid profile lowers the risk of coronary artery disease. It is claimed that yoga and transcendental meditation have a cholesterol lowering effect. This study was designed to assess the effect of raja yoga meditation of Brahmakumaris which is very simple to practice, on serum lipids in normal Indian women. Methods and Results: 49 normal female volunteers were the subjects. They were divided into pre-menopausal (n=23) and post-menopausal (n=26) groups. They were further divided into non-meditators (who had never done any kind of meditation), short-term meditators (meditating for 6 months to 5 years) and long-term meditators (meditating for more than 5 years). Lipid profile was assessed using their respective reagent sets. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in non-meditators were significantly more in post-menopausal women as compared to pre-menopausal women. Serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol were significantly lowered in both short and long term meditators as compared to non-meditators in post- menopausal women. No significant difference was observed in lipid profile in pre- menopausal women. Conclusion: Raja yoga meditation lowered serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein - cholesterol in post-menopausal women thus reducing the risk of coronary artery disease in them.","Coronary artery disease; Lipids profile; Meditators; Raja yoga meditation","high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; article; cholesterol blood level; cholesterol synthesis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; female; human; human experiment; India; lipid analysis; meditation; normal human; pilot study; postmenopause; premenopause; risk reduction; triacylglycerol blood level; women's health; yoga; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Female; Humans; Lipids; Meditation; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Postmenopause; Triglycerides; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650566928

The use of complementary methods (CMs) is widespread and increasing in the United States. Most literature on CM use among cancer survivors focuses on the treatment period, whereas only a few studies address use further along the cancer continuum. METHODS. This study analyzed the prevalence and the medical and demographic associations of CM use among cancer survivors surveyed 10 to 24 months after diagnosis. The study's sample - 4139 survivors of 1 of 10 adult cancers - was selected from stratified random samples provided by statewide cancer registries and surveyed by mail and telephone. Three logistic regression models examined associations between medical and demographic factors and CM use among survivors of sex-specific and non-sex-specific cancers. RESULTS. Of the 19 CMs included in the survey, the CMs most frequently reported were prayer/spiritual practice (61.4%), relaxation (44.3%), faith/spiritual healing (42.4%), nutritional supplements/vitamins (40.1%), meditation (15%), religious counseling (11.3%), massage (11.2%), and support groups (9.7%). Among these 19 CMs, the least prevalent were hypnosis (0.4%), biofeedback therapy (1.0%), and acupuncture/acupressure (1.2%). Survivors more likely to use CMs were female, younger, white, higher income, and more educated. CONCLUSIONS. This study provides information regarding prevalence and medical-demographic determinants of CM use reported by a large, population-based sample of survivors of 10 cancers surveyed 10 to 24 months after diagnosis. These findings may be used by clinicians and researchers to inform their decisions regarding which CMs to address in practice and research. © 2008 American Cancer Society.","Alternative medicine; Complementary methods; Prayer for healing; Study of cancer survivors-I","vitamin; acupressure; acupuncture; adult; aged; article; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer registry; cancer survivor; clinical decision making; clinical practice; colorectal cancer; complementary method; counseling; demography; feedback system; female; human; hypnosis; income; kidney cancer; leisure; logistic regression analysis; lung cancer; male; massage; medical information; medical research; meditation; melanoma; non profit organization; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nutrition; ovary cancer; physician; population research; prevalence; priority journal; prostate cancer; random sample; religion; sex; spiritual healing; support group; technique; telephone; uterus cancer; alternative medicine; methodology; middle aged; neoplasm; psychological aspect; register; statistical model; statistics; survivor; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Complementary Therapies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Registries; Survivors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049091658

As the number of cancer survivors continues to increase, so does the diversity of the survivorship population, making it increasingly important to understand and address the CAM culture in different survivor groups. Given the known communication barriers between cancer patients and their physicians regarding CAM, it would be useful for oncology providers to have a platform from which to discuss CAM-related issues. It is proposed that mind-body therapies with some basis in evidence could provide such a platform and also serve as a possible means of connecting cancer survivors to psychosocial supportive services.

It was demonstrated that emission intensities are lower in long-term practitioners of meditation as compared to control subjects. The percent contribution of emission from different anatomic locations was not significantly different for meditation practitioners and control subjects. Recently, a procedure was developed to analyze the fluctuations in the signals by measuring probabilities of detecting different numbers of photons in a bin and correct these for background noise. The procedure was tested utilizing the signal from three different body locations of a single subject, demonstrating that probabilities have non-classical features and are well described by the signal in a coherent state from the three body sites. The values indicate that the quantum state of photon emitted by the subject could be a coherent state in the subject being investigated. The objective in the present study was to systematically quantify, in subjects with long-term meditation experience and subjects without this experience, the photon count distribution of 12 different locations.

The inventory consists of questions related to one's feelings and attitude about various areas of life, such as happiness, achievement and interpersonal relationship. There was significant improvement in the subjective well being scores of the 77 subjects within a period of 10 days as compared to controls. These observations suggest that a short lifestyle modification and stress management educational program leads to remarkable improvement in the subjective well being scores of the subjects and can therefore make an appreciable contribution to primary prevention as well as management of lifestyle diseases.","Meditation; Subjective well being; Yoga","achievement; adult; aged; article; attitude to life; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; education program; female; happiness; human; human relation; hypertension; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; mental disease; observational study; outcome assessment; primary prevention; prospective study; psychological well being; scoring system; stress management; treatment duration; yoga; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Female; Happiness; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Life Style; Male; Meditation; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Personal Satisfaction; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Stress, Psychological; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50449100511

Studies on the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea experimental models of human breast cancer indicate that melatonin is effective in reducing cancer development. In vitro studies in MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line have shown that melatonin exerts its anticarcinogenic actions through a variety of mechanisms, and that it is most effective in estrogen receptor (ER) α-positive breast cancer cells. Melatonin suppresses ER gene, modulates several estrogen dependent regulatory proteins and pro-oncogenes, inhibits cell proliferation, and impairs the metastatic capacity of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The anticarcinogenic action on MCF-7 cells has been demonstrated at the physiological concentrations of melatonin attained at night, suggesting thereby that melatonin acts like an endogenous antiestrogen. Melatonin also decreases the formation of estrogens from androgens via aromatase inhibition. Circulating melatonin levels are abnormally low in ER-positive breast cancer patients thereby supporting the melatonin hypothesis for breast cancer in shift working women. It has been postulated that enhanced endogenous melatonin secretion is responsible for the beneficial effects of meditation as a form of psychosocial intervention that helps breast cancer patients. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Breast cancer; Estrogen receptor; Light at night; Meditation; Melatonin; Melatonin receptors; Shift-work","7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene; estrogen receptor alpha; melatonin; methylnitrosourea; antineoplastic activity; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer incidence; cell strain MCF 7; human; human cell; light; meditation; metastasis; priority journal; review; shift worker; Breast Neoplasms; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Humans; Light; Lighting; Melatonin; Occupational Exposure",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149179969

However, virtually nothing is known about the impact of the voluntary generation of compassion on this network. To investigate these questions we assessed brain activity using fMRI while novice and expert meditation practitioners generated a loving-kindness-compassion meditation state. To probe effective reactivity, we presented emotional and neutral sounds during the meditation and comparison periods. Our main hypothesis was that the contern for others cultivated during this form of medition enhances affective processing, in particularin response to sounds of distress, and that this response to emotional sounds is modulated by the degree of medication training. The presentattion of the emotional sonds was assoiciated with increased pupil diameter and activation of limbic regions (insula and cingulate cortices) during meditation (versus rest). During meditation, activation in insula was greater during presentation of negative sounds than positive or neutral sounds in expert than it was in novice meditators. The strength of activation in insula was also associated with self-reported intersity of the meditation for both groups. These results support the role of the limbic circuitry in emotion sharing. The comparison between meditation vs rest states between experts and novices also showed increased activation in amygdala, right temporo-paretal junction (TPJ), and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in response to all sounds, suggesting, greater detection of the emotional sounds, and enhanced mentation in response to emotional human vocalizations for experts than novices during meditation. Together these data indicate that the mental expertise to cultivate positive emotion alters the activation of circuitries previously linked to empathy and theory of mind in response to emotional stimuli. © 2008 Lutz et al.",,"adult; amygdaloid nucleus; article; auditory stimulation; brain function; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; emotionality; empathy; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; hypothesis; insula; limbic system; male; meditation; mental function; normal human; pain; parietal lobe; pupil; rest; self report; social behavior; stimulus response; temporal lobe; theory; thinking; vocalization; central nervous system; emotion; middle aged; physiology; Adult; Central Nervous System; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749115511

Rhawn Joseph has argued along the same lines in The Transmitter to Go: The Limbic System, the Soul, and Spirituality (2000). More recently, research on the neural correlate of religious experiences, such as Buddhist and Christian meditation, have become an interesting line of research for neuroscientists. The fact that a neural correlation of every religious experience can be identified, has led some authors to put forward the thesis that religion is fully explainable in terms of neural activity. I will try, first, to clarify whether we are allowed to identify the neural correlation of every human experience (its necessary condition) with its causation (or sufficient condition). Secondly, I will discuss the difference between internalist and externalist approaches in the study of the mind in general, and of the neural correlate of religious experiences, in particular.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of and factors related to the use of complementary/alternative medicine among cancer patients undergoing or following conventional treatment at the Erciyes University Oncology Hospital in Central Anatolia. Study design and patients. Face-to-face interview and a questionnaire were carried out with cancer patients attending the outpatient clinic of Medical Oncology. Questionnaire items included patients' demographic data, treatment, use of complementary/alternative medicine and possible related factors. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare the factors related to use of complementary/alternative medicine. Results. A total of 268 consecutive cancer patients were enrolled in the study. Overall, 43% of the patients were using or had used complementary/alternative medicine. Totally, 90% of the patients using complementary/alternative medicine utilized herbs, and most of the herbs used were stinging nettle. Nearly half of the patients using complementary/alternative medicine (46.1%) were aiming to fight the disease. Among users, nearly half of them regarded the method used as effective and 54 (50.5%) suggested the use of complementary/alternative medicine to other patients. Only 23.1% of the patients discussed the use of complementary/alternative medicine with their physician. In logistic regression analysis, younger age, higher educational status, advanced stage of the disease, longer duration of the disease and current treatment status were significantly associated with the use of complementary/alternative medicine. In our regression model, the predictivity rate of these variables was 72.2% for use of complementary/alternative medicine according to the backward Wald test. Conclusions. Use of complementary/alternative medicine among cancer patients in our center is modestly high, and the most common method is herbal therapy. Communication between the patient and the physician should be improved on this subject.","Alternative medicine; Cancer; Complementary medicine; Prevalence of use of complementary/alternative medicine","herbaceous agent; acupuncture; adult; aged; alternative medicine; article; cancer patient; disease duration; female; herbal medicine; human; interview; major clinical study; male; massage; meditation; patient attitude; prevalence; questionnaire; relaxation training; treatment outcome; Turkey (republic); Urtica dioica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61349175838

Based on the recording of F-VEPs (flash visual evoked potentials), this study was thus designed to investigate the characteristics of visual nervous pathway for the Zen-meditation practitioners (experimental group), in comparison with that for the normal, healthy subjects (control group). Flash stimuli were applied before, during and after meditation/relaxation in experimental/control subjects. We focused on the F-VEPs at the occipital site Oz, central site Cz and frontal site Fz. Our results show that amplitudes of late latency components N3-P3 and P3-N4 at Oz decrease for the experimental subjects during meditation, whereas they increase in the control group. Both Cz and Fz amplitudes increase during meditation, yet decrease during relaxation for the control group. The latencies of some components were increased under relaxation in control group, yet little variation (except P2) is observed in the meditators. We also applied discrete wavelet transform to F-VEPs to analyze the frequency components. Our results showed that delta, theta and alpha components increased during meditation at some specific time periods.

Patients and Methods: One hundred twenty-eight patients (42% African American, 31% Hispanic) recruited from an urban cancer center were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to a 12-week yoga intervention (n = 84) or a 12-week waitlist control group (n = 44). Changes in QOL (eg, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy) from before random assignment (T1) to the 3-month follow-up (T3) were examined; predictors of adherence were also assessed. Nearly half of all patients were receiving medical treatment. Results: Regression analyses indicated that the control group had a greater decrease in social well-being compared with the intervention group after controlling for baseline social well-being and covariates (P < .0001). Secondary analyses of 71 patients not receiving chemotherapy during the intervention period indicated favorable outcomes for the intervention group compared with the control group in overall QOL (P < .008), emotional well-being (P < .015), social well-being (P < .004), spiritual well-being (P < .009), and distressed mood (P < .031). Sixty-nine percent of intervention participants attended classes (mean number of classes attended by active class participants = 7.00 ± 3.80), with lower adherence associated with increased fatigue (P < .001), radiotherapy (P < .0001), younger age (P < .008), and no antiestrogen therapy (P < .02). Conclusion: Despite limited adherence, this intent-to-treat analysis suggests that yoga is associated with beneficial effects on social functioning among a medically diverse sample of breast cancer survivors. Among patients not receiving chemotherapy, yoga appears to enhance emotional well-being and mood and may serve to buffer deterioration in both overall and specific domains of QOL. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"adult; African American; analytic method; article; breast cancer; breathing; cancer patient; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled study; distress syndrome; ethnic difference; fatigue; female; Hispanic; human; major clinical study; male; meditation; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality of life; regression analysis; spiritual care; wellbeing; yoga; adaptive behavior; aged; breast tumor; controlled clinical trial; ethnology; middle aged; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; social adaptation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Social Adjustment; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348819350

In this study, we examined how the regular practice of meditation may affect the normal age-related decline of cerebral gray matter volume and attentional performance observed in healthy individuals. Voxel-based morphometry for MRI anatomical brain images and a computerized sustained attention task were employed in 13 regular practitioners of Zen meditation and 13 matched controls. While control subjects displayed the expected negative correlation of both gray matter volume and attentional performance with age, meditators did not show a significant correlation of either measure with age. The effect of meditation on gray matter volume was most prominent in the putamen, a structure strongly implicated in attentional processing.

In this study, the effects of puerarin on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in rat were verified and its effect on bone formation was evaluated. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Drug Screening Laboratory, Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Medical Collage of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces from March 2003 to March 2004. 1 Rats (Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences) were divided into 5 groups: Estrone (Zhejiang Xianju Pharmaceutical Factory) positive control group, blank control group (only with equal quantity of cells, without any drug), and 0.01, 0.1, 1 μmol/L puerarin groups (National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products). The osteoblasts were isolated from the calvaria of neonatal SD rats within 24 hours and cultured. The cells of 0.9×107/L were seeded in the 24-well culture plates with 12 wells in each group. After the cells were cultured for 1, 3 and 5 days, the cell number of 3 wells in every group was respectively counted and the growth curve of the cells was drawn. 2 The absorption was detected by MTT method at 1, 3 and 5 days, and the rates of average proliferation were calculated. The activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in and out of cells were detected by PNPP approach. Results: 1 Compared with control group, the proliferation of cells treated with 0.1 and 1 μmol/L puerarin or estrone was accelerated significantly after cultured for 3 or 5 days (P &lt; 0.01). 2 After the cells were treated with 1 μmol/L puerarin for 1, 3 and 5 days, the activities of ALP in and out of cells were increased significantly compared with control group (P &lt; 0.01). After the osteoblasts were treated with 0.1 μmol/L puerarin for 3 and 5 days, the activities of ALP was increased significantly compared with control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01). After the cells were treated with 0.01 μmol/L puerarin for 5 days, the activities of ALP out of cells were increased significantly compared with control group (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Puerarin promotes osteoblast to differentiate by influencing the activity of ALP and promotes bone formation by the meditation of estrogen receptor.",,"alkaline phosphatase; estrogen receptor; estrone; puerarin; animal cell; article; calculation; calvaria; cell count; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell isolation; cell proliferation; concentration response; controlled study; drug effect; enzyme activity; nonhuman; ossification; osteoblast; rat; statistical significance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36049043465

It has also been shown to improve alpha rhythm in healthy practitioners along with many other purported health benefits. Methods: The study was carried out on 30 patients suffering from major depression diagnosed on the basis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV criteria) and 30 healthy subjects who were screened for any sub-psychiatric illness by General Health Questionnaire (G.H.Q.). Patients and healthy subjects were then randomly divided into study and their respective control groups as follows: Group 1 (n=15): Patients who practiced Sahaj yoga meditation in addition to the conventional antidepressant medication. Group 2 (n=15): Patients received only antidepressant medication. Group 3 (n=15): Healthy subjects, who practiced Sahaj yoga. Group 4: (n=15) Healthy subjects who did not practice Sahaj yoga meditation. Group 1 and Group 3 subjects practiced Sahaj yoga meditation under the supervision of trained Sahaj Yogi for a period of 8 weeks. All the subjects were assessed for Alpha activity in EEG at 0 week (Pre-Test) and 8 weeks (Post-test) and results were statistically analyzed. Results: After 8 weeks, there was no statistically significant change in alpha activity (Pre vs. Post) in both groups (Group 1 and Group 2) of depressive patients. In healthy subjects, significant increase in alpha activity (p<0.001) was observed in Group 3 subjects only. Conclusion: Present study demonstrates beneficial effects of Sahaj yoga meditation on alpha activity in only healthy subjects with no acute beneficial effects being observed on these parameters in patients of major depression.","EEG; Major depression; Sahaj yoga","tricyclic antidepressant agent; adult; alpha rhythm; article; clinical article; clinical practice; controlled study; diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders; electroencephalography; female; human; major depression; male; medical education; meditation; questionnaire; screening test; yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549114741

Dysfunction may result from various oncologic therapies such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal manipulation, and cytostatic medication. Additionally, psychologic distress that the patient or her partner experiences during diagnosis and treatment of malignancy can impair a healthy female sexual response cycle. A sexual rehabilitation program in an oncology setting is necessary to provide comprehensive care to the cancer patient and her partner. A multidisciplinary treatment approach to sexual dysfunction includes psychological and psychiatric intervention, medical intervention, cognitive behavioral therapy, and recommended lifestyle adjustments. A holistic approach to assessing and treating sexual concerns should be individually tailored to the female patient in light of her disease stage and prognosis, age, marital status, fertility concerns, and social and professional environment.

This deficit is believed to result from competition between the two targets for limited attentional resources. Here we show, using performance in an attentional-blink task and scalp-recorded brain potentials, that meditation, or mental training, affects the distribution of limited brain resources. Three months of intensive mental training resulted in a smaller attentional blink and reduced brain-resource allocation to the first target, as reflected by a smaller T1-elicited P3b, a brain-potential index of resource allocation. Furthermore, those individuals that showed the largest decrease in brain-resource allocation to T1 generally showed the greatest reduction in attentional-blink size. These observations provide novel support for the view that the ability to accurately identify T2 depends upon the efficient deployment of resources to T1. The results also demonstrate that mental training can result in increased control over the distribution of limited brain resources. Our study supports the idea that plasticity in brain and mental function exists throughout life and illustrates the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study of the human mind. © 2007 Slagter et al.",,"adult; article; brain; brain region; cellular distribution; clinical article; controlled study; evoked response; female; human; information processing; longitudinal study; male; meditation; mental capacity; mental function; mental performance; nerve cell plasticity; resource allocation; task performance; attentional blink; brain; case control study; evoked visual response; meditation; middle aged; physiology; Adult; Attentional Blink; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250359114

Patients and Methods: Advanced cancer patients enrolling onto phase I trials were surveyed regarding biologically based CAM use. Decision-making preferences and awareness of prognosis were assessed using validated and/or standardized instruments. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General instrument was used to assess quality of life. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect differences between CAM users and nonusers. Results: Of 212 interviewed patients, 34% (n = 72) described taking biologically based CAM. Median age of those taking biologically based CAM was 55 years, compared with 62 years for nonusers (P < .005). There were no statistically significant differences found between CAM usage and preferences for degree of patient involvement in medical decision making. Those patients who acknowledged that their deaths were likely to occur within 1 year were more likely to admit to prior CAM use (70% v 34%; P = .02). CAM users had poorer overall quality of life compared with nonusers (87.0 ± 12.4 v 91.2 ± 14.7; P = .007). No differences in survival were identified. Conclusion: Prior CAM use among phase I cancer trial patients studied was common and associated with age, stated acknowledgment of prognosis, and quality of life. Patients enrolling onto early-phase trials should be questioned about CAM use. Additional study is needed to determine the frequency of use of those biologically based CAM agents that threaten the accuracy of early-phase cancer trial data. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; cyanocobalamin; ginseng extract; herbaceous agent; Hypericum perforatum extract; magnesium; retinol; selenium; vitamin; vitamin D; antineoplastic agent; plant medicinal product; vitamin; adult; advanced cancer; aged; alternative medicine; article; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer survival; clinical decision making; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; exercise; female; functional assessment; human; Hypericum perforatum; major clinical study; male; meditation; multivariate analysis; patient compliance; phase 1 clinical trial; priority journal; prognosis; quality of life; statistical significance; treatment duration; univariate analysis; alternative medicine; attitude to health; decision making; diet supplementation; herb drug interaction; methodology; middle aged; neoplasm; patient; patient participation; phase 1 clinical trial; psychological aspect; questionnaire; treatment outcome; United States; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Attitude to Health; Chicago; Clinical Trials, Phase I; Complementary Therapies; Decision Making; Dietary Supplements; Female; Herb-Drug Interactions; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Participation; Patients; Plant Preparations; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Vitamins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947505554

A self-administered questionnaire was offered to 640 nursing students in Istanbul, descriptive statistics were used, and comparisons among responses were made with chi-square test. Willingness to use for cancer patients was highest for nutritional therapy (76.1%), breathing therapies (74.5%), and massage and manipulation-Tui Na, in which pressure and touch are applied to the body (71.9%). Use of information sources was highest for nutritional therapy (75.6%), breathing therapies (71.9%), and massage and manipulation-Tui Na (62.3%). Over half of the nursing students used music therapy (54.2%), and massage and manipulation-Tui Na (53.6%) for self-care. Breathing therapies (87.2%) were the most desired therapy chosen to be included in nuising curriculum. The statistically significant differences were found among the responses related to use five therapies for care and related to desired three therapies to be included in nursing curriculum. Although students had not previously been exposed to these therapies use with oncology patients, many of students expressed a desire to integrate therapies learning into nursing curriculum.

This finding stimulated the demand for techniques that can effectively manipulate the stress perception. The influence of stress on college students lasts longer at the age when there is a fast development of personality and life viewpoint. This survey study thus mainly examines the effect of Zen-meditation practice on stress manipulation in college students. 541 college students were divided into two groups, with Zen-meditation practice in their daily lives and those who do not meditate. To evaluate the perceived stress of participants, DASS questionnaire was used to measure their negative emotional states (depression, anxiety and stress/tension). The results showed that (1) considerably high percentage of college students who did not practice Zen meditation exhibited negative emotional problem (depression: 45%; anxiety: 48%; stress/tension: 50%); (2) a much lower percentage of students with meditation practice encountered the negative emotional problem (depression: 8%; anxiety: 30%; stress/tension: 12%). This study reflects the benefits of meditation on stress manipulation. It may also imply that having more meditation, having longer meditation time, and doing meditation more frequently could further improve the states of negative emotion. It also implies that meditation experience played a considerable role in effectively manipulating some stress symptoms like depression and anxiety.

Change in environment, food habits and life-style and increasing stress level at work place and in the family are among the major causes of infertility. In Indian societies, especially in rural and uneducated areas, females are often held responsible for infertility causes, as males are considered to be perpetually fertile. Husband abandoning wife on this ground is not uncommon. Also, many social stigmas are associated with this reproductive dysfunction. However, with changing socioeconomic equations, recently it has been observed that the male infertility is on the rise. Therefore, in this minireview, we have attempted to assess the physiological basis of male infertility in the changing socio-environmental scenario in present times and we have also attempted to address the possibilities, consequences and physiological basis of management of such a common dysfunction human race facing at the present.","Environmental factors; Infertility; Leukocytospermia; Males; Stress","acetylcysteine; albumin; alpha tocopherol; anabolic agent; antiandrogen; antibiotic agent; ascorbic acid; atenolol; calcium channel blocking agent; captopril; catalase; diuretic agent; enalapril; erythromycin; gentamicin; hydralazine; metoprolol; minoxidil; neomycin; nitrofurantoin; penicillin G; propranolol; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; spironolactone; superoxide dismutase; tetracycline; ubidecarenone; alcoholism; azoospermia; cigarette smoking; drug megadose; environmental factor; erectile dysfunction; feeding behavior; female infertility; fertilization; genital tract infection; human; hypertension; incidence; India; infertility; job stress; leukocytospermia; libido; lifestyle; male infertility; male sexual dysfunction; meditation; music therapy; occupational exposure; oxidative stress; penile blood flow; penis erection; religion; review; semen abnormality; sexual function; side effect; socioeconomics; sperm quality; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon density; spermatozoon motility; testis development; vascular resistance; workplace",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549155640

We here present the findings for the elderly cohort in our recently conducted national survey on CAM use by adult Australians. In May and June 2005, computer-assisted telephone interviews, using random-digit telephone dialing, were employed to gather data on CAM use in the last 12 months. Of 1067 adult participants interviewed, 178 were 65 or older. More than half of these (57.8%; 95% CI, 50.7%-64.9%) had used at least one of 17 common forms of CAM and 60.4% of the CAM users had consulted CAM practitioners. Clinical nutrition, chiropractic, massage therapy, meditation, and herbal medicine were the most common forms of CAM used by the elderly. A higher proportion of the elderly had always used both CAM and conventional medical treatments (37.9%) than had those aged 18-34 (15.7%) and 35-64 (26.9%). Elderly CAM users (60.2%) were more likely than younger users to discuss their use with their doctors. Of those who did not do so, 24.1% were not asked by their doctors and 16.0% considered that their doctor would disapprove. In conclusion, we found that a substantial proportion of older Australians use CAM. The elderly are also more likely than younger adults to discuss their use of CAM with their doctors, but doctors need to play a more active role in initiating such communication. © 2007 New York Academy of Sciences.","CAM use; Complementary and alternative medicine; Older Australians; Population-based survey","adult; aged; alternative medicine; Australia; chiropractic; cohort analysis; computer aided design; conference paper; confidence interval; controlled study; female; health survey; herbal medicine; human; information service; interview; male; massage; meditation; nutritional assessment; physician",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948978141

METHODS: Databases were searched up to August 2006. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing qigong in patients with hypertension of any origin and assessing clinically relevant outcomes were considered. Trials using any type of control intervention were included. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Jadad score. RESULTS: A total of 121 potentially relevant articles were identified and 12 RCTs were included. Seven RCTs tested qigong in combination with antihypertensive drugs compared with antihypertensive drugs alone. The meta-analysis of two trials reporting adequate data suggested beneficial effects in favour of qigong [weighted mean difference, systolic blood pressure (SBP) -12.1 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.1 to -7.0; diastolic blood pressure -8.5 mmHg, 95% CI -12.6 to -4.4]. Qigong was compared with waiting list control in two RCTs and was found to reduce SBP significantly (weighted mean difference -18.5 mmHg, 95% CI -23.1 to -13.9). In three further RCTs the comparisons made were: qigong combined with conventional therapy versus muscle relaxation combined with conventional therapy; qigong as a sole treatment versus exercise. All reported positive results in at least some of the relevant outcome measures. The methodological quality of the studies was low. CONCLUSION: There is some encouraging evidence of qigong for lowering SBP, but the conclusiveness of these findings is limited. Rigorously designed trials are warranted to confirm these results. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Blood pressure; Hypertension; Qigong; Systematic review","antihypertensive agent; clonidine; dihydralazine; guanethidine; herbaceous agent; hydrochlorothiazide; nifedipine; propranolol; reserpine; antihypertensive activity; antihypertensive therapy; anxiety; blood pressure regulation; body movement; breathing pattern; Chinese medicine; clinical trial; confidence interval; data base; depression; diastolic blood pressure; exercise; human; hypertension; intermethod comparison; jogging; kinesiotherapy; life satisfaction; medical literature; meditation; methodology; mortality; muscle relaxation; priority journal; quality control; quality of life; Quijong; review; scoring system; stroke; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; treatment outcome; wellbeing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447295616

Group 2: (9 males and 6 Females) Patients who only received conventional anti-depressant medication. Group 1 patients were administered Sahaj Yoga practice for 8 weeks.

Also, there was significant improvement in RDS scores in only Group 1 subjects (P<0.05). The results thereby, demonstrate that Sahaj Yoga practice in addition to the improvement in various other cognitive domains seen with conventional anti-depressants, can lead to additional improvement in executive functions like manipulation of information in the verbal working memory and added improvement in attention span and visuo-motor speed of the depressives.","Major depression; Neuro-cognitive functions; Sahaj yoga","antidepressant agent; serotonin uptake inhibitor; tricyclic antidepressant agent; adult; anxiety; article; clinical article; clinical trial; cognition; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; Hamilton scale; human; major depression; male; psychologic test; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; short term memory; socioeconomics; treatment outcome; visuomotor coordination; working memory; yoga; Adolescent; Adult; Cognition; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychomotor Performance; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751170643

Yogic practices are claimed to enhance the quality of sleep. Electrophysiological correlates associated with the higher states of consciousness have been reported in long-term practitioners of transcendental meditation during deep sleep states. The present study was carried out to assess sleep architecture in Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) and Vipassana meditators. This was to ascertain the differences, if any, in sleep architecture following yogic practices. Whole night polysomnographic recordings were carried out in 78 healthy male subjects belonging to control and yoga groups. The groups studied were aged between 20 and 30-years-old (younger) and 31 to 55-years-old (middle-aged). The sleep architecture was comparable among the younger control and yoga groups. While slow wave sleep (non-REM (rapid eye movement) S3 and S4) had reduced to 3.7 percent in the middle-aged control group, participants of the middle-aged yoga groups (both SKY and Vipassana) showed no such decline in slow wave sleep states, which was experienced by 11.76 and 12.76 percent, respectively, of the SKY and Vipassana groups. However, Vipassana practitioners showed a significant enhancement (P &lt; 0.001) in their REM sleep state from that of the age-matched control subjects and also from their SKY counterparts. Yoga practices help to retain slow wave sleep and enhance the REM sleep state in the middle age; they appear to retain a younger biological age as far as sleep is concerned. Overall, the study demonstrates the possible beneficial role of yoga in sleep-wakefulness behavior. © 2006 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2006 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.","Sleep architecture; Slow wave sleep and REM sleep; Sudarshan Kriya yoga; Vipassana meditation","serotonin 3 receptor; serotonin 4 receptor; adult; age distribution; alternative medicine; brain electrophysiology; conference paper; consciousness level; controlled study; correlation analysis; health practitioner; human; human experiment; India; male; nonREM sleep; normal human; polysomnography; priority journal; relaxation training; REM sleep; sleep pattern; sleep waking cycle; slow brain wave; slow wave sleep; statistical significance; transcendental meditation; yoga",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748680931

In the realm of psycho-oncology, however, conceptual models on this topic and studies aimed at their validation have remained relatively scanty. On the basis of our observations and available literature in the field of post-traumatic and depressive stress disorders in oncology, we have proposed to apply the concept of allostatic load to the study and understanding of the psychological experience of cancer. This strategy has led us to the formulation of a novel classification of adjustment disorders in oncology and the creation of the clinical entity named «cancer-specific stress syndrome». Depending on clinical presentation of the syndrome, one distinguishes three subtypes, namely the depressive, post-traumatic and «dysallostatic» (mixed) forms. In the present paper, we examine the role of glucocorticoids and their relationships with one of the basic components of allostatic load - a failure to counter-regulate the immune system by the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis - in the physiopathology of stress disorders in oncology. Conflicting theories are presented-glucocorticoid cascade versus insufficient glucocorticoid signal transmission - and studies measuring potential correlations between stress and cortisol in oncology are critically reviewed.

There are disparities in the prevalence of hypertension, its treatment and control with respect to age, sex, racial groups and education. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of high BP (JNC 7 report) provides lifestyle modification with and without pharmacological intervention recommendations for preventing and treating different stages of hypertension. Recently, nonpharmacological approaches including yoga, meditation, acupressure and acupuncture have been considered as potential therapeutic options. Acupuncture has been used empirically for nearly 3000 years to treat a variety of diseases, including cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hypotension, coronary disease and certain arrhythmias. Previous studies suggest that short and chronic elevation in BP can be lowered in animal models and human subjects. However, the mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effects of acupuncture are not yet fully understood. An increasing interest in acupuncture healthcare has led to a growing number of investigators to pursue research in this field. This article briefly summarizes available studies, including our own reports, that demonstrate evidence for acupuncture modulation of cardiovascular function, particularly BP reduction, and concludes that future treatment of hypertension can potentially include acupuncture as a nonpharmacological intervention. © 2006 Future Medicine Ltd.","Acupuncture; Blood pressure; Electroacupuncture; Manual acupuncture; Opioids","aldosterone; angiotensin II; endorphin; noradrenalin; renin; serotonin; acupressure; acupuncture; alternative medicine; antihypertensive activity; behavior modification; blood pressure regulation; blood viscosity; capillary flow; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular function; chronic disease; clinical trial; coronary artery disease; endocrine system; geography; health care utilization; human; hypertension; hypotension; lifestyle; meditation; nonhuman; priority journal; review; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646539114

Based on wavelet analysis, we derived a set of parameters that effectively signify the alpha-suppressed EEG pattern. Furthermore, this paper presents our new results of analyzing the F-VEP data, mainly the peak amplitude.

This paper reviews the use of CAM in a series of patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Methods: Women with LABC attending a specialist clinic at a single Canadian cancer centre were identified and approached. Participants completed a self-administered survey regarding CAM usage, beliefs associated with CAM usage, views of their risks of developing recurrent cancer and of dying of breast cancer. Responses were scored and compared between CAM users and non-users. Results: Thirty-six patients were approached, 32 completed the questionnaire (response rate 89%). Forty-seven percent of LABC patients were identified as CAM users. CAM users were more likely to be younger, married, in a higher socioeconomic class and of Asian ethnicity than non-users. CAM users were likely to use multiple modalities simultaneously (median 4) with vitamins being the most popular (60%). Motivation for CAM therapy was described as, ""assisting their body to heal"" (75%), to 'boost the immune system' (56%) and to ""give a feeling of control with respect to their treatment"" (56%). CAM therapy was used concurrently with conventional treatment in 88% of cases, however, 12% of patients felt that CAM could replace their conventional therapy. Psychological evaluation suggests CAM users perceived their risk of dying of breast cancer was similar to that of the non-Cam group (33% vs. 35%), however the CAM group had less severe anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The motivation, objectives and benefits of CAM therapy in a selected population of women with LABC are similar to those reported for women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. CAM users display less anxiety and depression and are less likely to believe they will die of their breast cancer. However the actual benefit to overall and disease free survival has yet to be demonstrated, as well as the possible interactions with conventional therapy. Consequently more research is needed in this evergrowing field. © 2006 Helyer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"antineoplastic agent; multivitamin; acupuncture; adult; advanced cancer; age; aged; alternative medicine; anxiety; article; Asian; breast cancer; breast surgery; Canada; cancer center; cancer chemotherapy; cancer localization; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer staging; chiropractic; clinical article; controlled study; depression; diet therapy; disease severity; ethnology; female; guided imagery; healing; health belief; health survey; homeopathy; human; hypnosis; immunomodulation; marriage; massage; medical research; meditation; outcomes research; psychologic assessment; questionnaire; religion; risk assessment; scoring system; socioeconomics; Tai Chi; vitamin supplementation; yoga; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Attitude to Health; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Middle Aged; Motivation; Neoplasm Staging; Perception; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744926409

The magnetic field potentials corresponding to TM-induced alpha activities on EEG recordings were extracted, and we attempted to localize the dipole sources using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, equivalent current dipole source analysis, and the multiple spatio-temporal dipole model. Since the dipoles were mapped to both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), it is suggested that the mPFC and ACC play an important role in brain activity induced by TM.

We have done a systematic review of studies published between 1995 and February 2005, identified through a comprehensive search. CAM encompasses a wide range of treatment modalities, including dietary and vitamin supplements, mind-body approaches, acupuncture, and herbal medicines. The objectives of CAM treatments are diverse: reduction of therapy-associated toxicity, improvement of cancer-related symptoms, fostering of the immune system and even direct anticancer effects. Clinical trials have generated few or no data on the efficacy of CAM, whether regarding disease recurrence, survival, overall quality of life or safety. Some CAM methods may even have adverse effects or reduce the efficacy of conventional treatment. The primary justification for CAM is based on empirical evidence, case studies, and hypothetical physiological effects. We conclude that available data on CAM modalities in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer does not support their application. © Springer 2005.","Acupuncture; Breast cancer; Herbals; Mistletoe; Phytoestrogens; Proteolytic enzymes; Psychological therapies; Soy; Trace elements; Vitamins","alpha tocopherol; Angelica sinensis extract; ascorbic acid; beta carotene; bexarotene; Cimicifuga racemosa extract; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; fenretinide; fluorouracil; garlic extract; Glycyrrhiza glabra extract; herbaceous agent; Humulus lupulus extract; methotrexate; nicotinamide; nicotinic acid; paclitaxel; phytoestrogen; red clover extract; retinoid X receptor; retinol; tamoxifen; trace element; ubiquinone; unindexed drug; Viscum album extract; Viscum album lectin; vitamin; vitamin B group; acupuncture; alternative medicine; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; clinical trial; diet supplementation; drug induced cancer; early cancer; evidence based medicine; herbal medicine; human; hypnosis; immune system; interstitial nephritis; liver toxicity; meditation; menopausal syndrome; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; patient safety; priority journal; psychotherapy; quality of life; review; ritual; systematic review; Viscum album; vitamin supplementation; Breast Neoplasms; Complementary Therapies; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Herbal Medicine; Humans; Medicine, Herbal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645214868

Samadhi is a self-absorptive, adaptive state with realization of one's being in harmony with reality. It is unitive, undifferentiated, reality-consciousness, an essential being, which can only be experienced by spontaneous intuition and self-understanding. Modern neuroscience can help us to better understand Dhyana-Yoga. This article discusses topics including brain-mind-reality, consciousness, attention, emotional intelligence, sense of self, meditative mind, and meditative brain. A new hypothesis is proposed for a better understanding of the meditative mind. Meditation is an art of being serene and alert in the present moment, instead of constantly struggling to change or to become. It is an art of efficient management of attentional energy with total engagement (poornata, presence, mindfulness) or disengagement (shunyata, silence, emptiness). In both states, there is an experience of spontaneous unity with no sense of situational interactive self or personal time. It is a simultaneous, participatory consciousness rather than a dualistic, sequential attentiveness. There is a natural sense of well being with self-understanding, spontaneous joy, serenity, freedom, and self-fulfillment. It is where the ultimate pursuit of happiness and the search for meaning of life resolve. One realizes the truth of one's harmonious being in nature and nature in oneself. It is being alive at its fullest, when each conscious moment becomes a dynamic process of discovery and continuous learning of the ever-new unfolding reality.",,"alternative medicine; attention; consciousness; human; meditation; methodology; neuroscience; physiology; psychological aspect; review; Attention; Consciousness; Humans; Meditation; Mind-Body Relations (Metaphysics); Neurosciences",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548380410

The prevalence of CAM use among cancer patients in the United States has been estimated to be between 7% and 54%. Most cancer patients use CAM with the hope of boosting the immune system, relieving pain, and controlling side effects related to disease or treatment. Only a minority of patients include CAM in the treatment plan with curative intent. This review article focuses on practices belonging to the CAM domains of mind-body medicine, CAM botanicals, manipulative practices, and energy medicine, because they are widely used as complementary approaches to palliative cancer care and cancer symptom management. In the area of cancer symptom management, auricular acupuncture, therapeutic touch, and hypnosis may help to manage cancer pain. Music therapy, massage, and hypnosis may have an effect on anxiety, and both acupuncture and massage may have a therapeutic role in cancer fatigue. Acupuncture and selected botanicals may reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis, and hypnosis and guided imagery may be beneficial in anticipatory nausea and vomiting. Transcendental meditation and the mindfulness-based stress reduction can play a role in the management of depressed mood and anxiety. Black cohosh and phytoestrogen-rich foods may reduce vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Most CAM approaches to the treatment of cancer are safe when used by a CAM practitioner experienced in the treatment of cancer patients. The potential for many commonly used botanical to interact with prescription drugs continues to be a concern. Botanicals should be used with caution by cancer patients and only under the guidance of an oncologist knowledgeable in their use.

The study was the result of operational research carried out in the Integral Health Clinic (IHC) at the Department of Physiology of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The subjects had history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, 'stress'), gastrointestinal problems (non ulcer dyspepsia, duodenal ulcers, irritable bowel disease, Crohn's disease, chronic constipation) and thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). The intervention consisted of asanas, pranayama, relaxation techniques, group support, individualized advice, and lectures and films on philosophy of yoga, the place of yoga in daily life, meditation, stress management, nutrition, and knowledge about the illness. The outcome measures were anxiety scores, taken on the first and last day of the course. Anxiety scores, both state and trait anxiety were significantly reduced. Among the diseased subjects significant improvement was seen in the anxiety levels of patients of hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, cervical spondylitis and those with psychiatric disorders. The observations suggest that a short educational programme for lifestyle modification and stress management leads to remarkable reduction in the anxiety scores within a period of 10 days.","Anxiety; State anxiety; Trait anxiety; Yoga","adult; aged; anxiety; anxiety disorder; article; cervical spondylosis; constipation; coronary artery disease; Crohn disease; depression; diabetes mellitus; duodenum ulcer; dyspepsia; education program; female; gastrointestinal symptom; group psychology; human; hypertension; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; irritable colon; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; meditation; mental disease; nutrition; obesity; pathogenesis; relaxation training; scoring system; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; stress; yoga; Adult; Aged; Anxiety Disorders; Female; Humans; India; Life Style; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Patient Education; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344478515

The patients were then randomly divided into two groups: Group 1: (10 Males & 5 Females) Patients who were practising Sahaj Yoga and also received conventional anti-depressants. Group 2: (9 Males & 6 Females) Patients who were only receiving conventional anti-depressants. Training in Sahaj yoga was conducted under the supervision of a trained Sahaj Yogi for 8 weeks. At start of the study, all the patients were subjected to Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Above scales were again assessed after two months of treatment. There was significant improvement in HAM-D as well as HAM-A scores in both Group 1 and Group 2 patients (P<0.001).

However, FCM applied straightforward to quantitative feature vectors often results in an over-trifling interpretation.

However, few studies have examined the relationship between habitual behaviors and light, the strongest zeitgeber. Depression is an ideal model in which to explore this relationship because depression is a disorder associated with disruptions in circadian biological activity, sleep, and social rhythms (or patterns of habitual behaviors). We hypothesized that individuals with fewer habitual behaviors have less average exposure to light from morning rise time to evening bedtime and that a reduction in light exposure increases the likelihood of depression. Thirty-nine depressed and 39 never-depressed participants wore an ambulatory light monitor and completed the Social Rhythm Metric over the course of 2 weeks. Linear and logistic regression techniques were used to calculate regression coefficients, and confidence limits based on the distribution of the product of two normal random variables were computed to test the significance of the mediation effect. Infrequent habitual behaviors were associated with a decrease in average levels of light exposure, and low levels of light increased the likelihood of depression. This mediation effect was partial; the overall number of habitual behaviors had a direct relationship with depression above and beyond the association with light exposure. Longitudinal studies are needed to empirically demonstrate the direction of relationships between each of the variables tested.

The inefficiency and failure of maintenance, repair and turnover pathways is the main cause of age-related accumulation of damage. Research in molecular gerontology is aimed at understanding the genetic and epigenetic regulation of survival and maintenance mechanisms at the levels of transcription, post-transcriptional processing, post-translational modifications, and interactions among various gene products. Concurrently, several approaches are being tried and tested to modulate ageing in a wide variety of organisms. The ultimate aim of such studies is to improve the quality of human life in old age and prolong the health-span. Various gerontomodulatory approaches include gene therapy, hormonal supplementation, nutritional modulation and intervention by free radical scavengers and other molecules. A recent approach is that of applying hormesis in ageing research and therapy, which is based on the principle of stimulation of maintenance and repair pathways by repeated exposure to mild stress.

It reflects a decreasing reliance on externals for definition of the self, increasing interiority and spirituality, and a greater sense of connectedness with past and future generations. The Adult Self-Transcendence Inventory was administered to 351 individuals along with the NEO-FFI Personality Scale (McCrae & Costa, 1989). A principal axis factor analysis identified two factors: self-transcendence and alienation. The relationships between self-transcendence and neuroticism, openness to experience, extraversion, and agreeableness were significant, although modest, suggesting that self-transcendence cannot be accounted for in terms of positive personality traits alone.

No research has directly addressed Bowen's notion that level of differentiation impacts child functioning including aggression. Level of differentiation is discussed in conjunction with social, gender and cultural norms as manifested in aggressive behavior. Female adolescent aggression is described as mainly relationship focused and expressed via verbal threats, intimidation and manipulation, while male aggression is described mainly as overt physical violence involving dominance and competitiveness. Research on differentiation focuses mainly on Western cultures that tend to be individualistic. Jewish-Israeli society is in transition from collectivistic to individualistic cultural values in the midst of ongoing hostilities. These processes create conflict regarding togetherness and individuality needs among adolescents, who are exposed to contradictory messages regarding separating and staying close. External as well as internal expressions of aggression (depression, suicide) are presented as coping strategies in the service of a wounded self-negotiating with the world. Guided mindfulness meditation is a powerful technique for facilitating healing and growth toward autonomy by helping adolescents connect to their inner voice. This technique may be especially useful in the adolescent search for self-awareness, meaning and life purpose.

Recent research has identified some of the likely molecular mediators of these potentially broad-ranging, health-enhancing and anti-aging effects; these include DHEA, interleukins -10 and -4 (IL-10, 1L-4), and especially melatonin. Relatedly, what some are calling a revolution in biology and medicine has been emerging from research on stem cells and regeneration processes more generally. Dogma regarding limitations on the regenerative capacities of adult vertebrates is being cautiously yet enthusiastically revised in the wake of rapidly accumulating discoveries of more types of adult stem cells in mammals, including humans. For example, a recent review by D. Krause of Yale concluded that ""in the [adult] bone marrow, in addition to hematopoietic stem cells and supportive stromal cells, there are cells with the potential to differentiate into mature cells of the heart, liver, kidney, lungs, GI tract, skin, bone, muscle, cartilage, fat, endothelium and brain."" In addition, very recent studies have shown that DHEA, ILs-10 and -4, and melatonin all possess potential regenerative, including stem cell-activating, properties. More than a quarter of a century ago, Walter Pierpaoli initiated a series of extraordinary studies that demonstrated in experimental animals the potential for dramatic regeneration associated with changes in the pineal gland and bone marrow. This appeared to be not only retardation of aging, but also its reversal. Furthermore, as Pierpaoli was attempting to understand both anti-aging regeneration and oncogenesis, he was focusing on both pro- and anti-mitotic mechanisms: recent research now suggests that there is a nonpathologic, ""healthy"" form of regeneration that is actually antagonistic to oncogenesis, and that melatonin may be important in this form of regeneration. This paper explores Pierpaoli's pioneering studies in light of recent developments in stem cell and regenerative biology, particularly as related to the regenerative potential associated with certain cognitive-behavioral practices, and includes evidence on this subject presented for the first time. © 2004 New York Academy of Sciences.","Aging reversal; Anti-inflammatory; Anti-stress; Anticancer; Antioxidant; Bone marrow; Calorie restriction; Cognitive-behavioral; Exercise; Interleukin-10; Longevity; Meditation; Melatonin; Negligible senescence; Pineal; Regeneration; Stem cells; Transferrin; Yoga","brain derived neurotrophic factor; cytokine; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; melatonin; melatonin receptor; nerve growth factor; aging; behavior; bone marrow; caloric restriction; cancer prevention; central nervous system; cognition; conference paper; exercise; human; immune system; longevity; meditation; nerve regeneration; Parkinson disease; pineal body; senescence; stem cell; yoga; Animalia; Mammalia; Vertebrata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-32244443348

Complementary medical therapies have the potential to affect many physiological systems. Repeatedly studies show the benefits of the placebo response and relaxation techniques in the treatment of hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety and mild and moderate depression, premenstrual syndrome, and infertility. In itself, relaxation is characterized by a decreased metabolism, heart rate, blood pressure, and rate of breathing as well as an increase in skin temperature. Relaxation approaches, such as progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, meditation and biofeedback, are effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients by a significant margin. Given this association with changes in vascular tone, we have hypothesized that nitric oxide, a demonstrated vasodilator substance, contribute to physiological activity of relaxation approaches. We examined the scientific literature concerning the disorders noted earlier for their nitric oxide involvement in an attempt to provide a molecular rationale for the positive effects of relaxation approaches, which are physiological and cognitive process.

The study was performed in 10 healthy subjects in three sessions (control, relaxation and stress). The control session was composed of 30-min recordings before and 30-min recordings after a test meal. The protocol of two other sessions was similar except that the fasting recording was extended to 60 min and the subjects were continuously watching a horror movie (stress) or guided meditation tape (relaxation) after the 30-min baseline. GMA was recorded using electrogastrography and heart rate variability (HRV) was derived from the electrocardiogram. Meal resulted in a postprandial increase in the dominant frequency (2.91 cpm vs 3.17 cpm, P < 0.007), dominant power (30.0 dB vs 32.5 dB, P < 0.05), and percentage of normal slow waves (79.8% vs 87.4%, P = 0.09). Similar responses were found in the relaxation session. Stress inhibited all these normal postprandial response and reduced the regularity of gastric slow waves (82.0% vs 66.0%, P < 0.01). In addition, spectral analysis of the HRV demonstrated an inhibition of postprandial vagal activity and an increase of postprandial sympathetic activity with stress. Stress has an inhibitory effect on postprandial GMA and this may involve both vagal and sympathetic pathway.","Electrogastrography; Gastric motility; Gastric myoelectrical activity; Heart rate variability; Stress","adult; article; controlled study; electrogastrography; female; heart rate variability; human; male; meditation; mental stress; myoelectricity; normal human; postprandial state; priority journal; stomach innervation; sympathetic tone; vagus tone; Adult; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Myoelectric Complex, Migrating; Postprandial Period; Stomach; Stress, Psychological; Vagus Nerve",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144330654

Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life. Yoga, an ancient Eastern science, incorporates stress-reduction techniques that include regulated breathing, visual imagery, and meditation as well as various postures. The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga (TY) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor, which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low-impact postures in patients with lymphoma. METHODS. Thirty-nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait-list control group. Patients in the TY group participated in 7 weekly yoga sessions, and patients in the wait-list control group were free to participate in the TY program after the 3-month follow-up assessment. RESULTS. Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2-3 three yoga sessions, and 58% completed at least 5 sessions. Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P < 0.004). This included better subjective sleep quality (P < 0.02), faster sleep latency (P < 0.01), longer sleep duration (P < 0.03), and less use of sleep medications (P < 0.02). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance, state anxiety, depression, or fatigue. CONCLUSIONS. The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep-related outcomes. However, there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes. © 2004 American Cancer Society.","Distress; Lymphoma; Sleep; Tibet; Yoga","cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; prednisone; vincristine; adult; article; body posture; breathing; China; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; human; imagination; lymphoma; male; meditation; priority journal; psychological aspect; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; relaxation training; sleep; sleep disorder; sleep pattern; sleep time; social adaptation; statistical significance; stress; traditional medicine; trul khor; tsa lung; visual adaptation; yoga; Adaptation, Psychological; Female; Humans; Lymphoma; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Sleep; Stress, Psychological; Tibet; Treatment Outcome; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342582178

The present study was undertaken to observe critically the energy cost and different cardiorespiratory changes during the practice of SN. Twenty-one male volunteers from the Indian Army practiced selected Yogic exercises for six days in a week for three months duration. The Yogic practice schedule consisted of Hatha Yogic Asanas (28 min), Pranayama (10.5 min) and Meditation (5 min). In the Yogic practice schedule 1st they practiced Kapal Bhathi (breathing maneuvers) for 2 min then Yogamudra (yogic postural exercise) for 2 min, after that they took rest until oxygen consumption and heart rate (HR) came to resting value. Subsequently subjects performed SN for 3 min 40 seconds on an average. After three months of training at the beginning of the fourth month subjects performed entire Yogic practice schedule in the laboratory as they practiced during their training session and experiments were carried out. Their pulmonary ventilation, carbondioxide output, Oxygen consumption, HR and other cardiorespiratory parameters were measured during the actual practice of SN. Oxygen consumption was highest in the eighth posture (1.22 ± 0.073 1 min-1) and lowest in the first posture (0.35 ± 0.02 1 min -1). Total energy cost throughout the practice of SN was 13.91 kcal and at an average of 3.79 kcal/min. During its practice highest HR was 101 ± 13.5 b.p.m. As an aerobic exercise SN seemed to be ideal as it involves both static stretching and slow dynamic component of exercise with optimal stress on the cardiorespiratory system.","Cardiorespiratory changes; Energy cost; Hatha Yoga; Surya Namaskar","adult; army; article; body posture; breathing mechanics; breathing pattern; carbon dioxide measurement; cardiopulmonary hemodynamics; energy cost; energy metabolism; exercise; heart rate; human; human experiment; India; lung function test; lung ventilation; male; meditation; muscle stretching; normal human; oxygen consumption; rest; stress; surya namaskar; yoga; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Energy Metabolism; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Pulmonary Ventilation; Yoga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842471941

Method: Searches were made of electronic databases and the collected papers and official web sites of the TM organization. We included only randomized clinical trials, without confounding co-interventions, which measured the cumulative effects of TM on blood pressure. Results: Six trials met the inclusion criteria but one, reported only in abstract form, could not be evaluated. Procedures for establishing baseline blood pressure were adequate in only one trial. Only one of the trials included a follow-on assessment and only one of the evaluable trials tested the effect of TM in hypertensive individuals. Three of the five evaluable trials reported statistically significant differences between intervention groups favouring TM and two found no significant differences between intervention groups. None of the five studies was conducted by independent authors without any affiliation to the TM organization. Conclusion: All the randomized clinical trials of TM for the control of blood pressure published to date have important methodological weaknesses and are potentially biased by the affiliation of authors to the TM organization.

CAM therapies are often used for the treatment of side-effects of cancer or cancer therapy, and only rarely as an alternative to conventional therapy. Regulation of CAM therapies varies worldwide, and many therapies have not been subject to scientifically conducted analyses. Adverse events have been described, especially from the contamination of herbs. Only rare reports of interactions of CAM therapies with conventional anticancer treatments have been reported. Several research studies of CAM in children with cancer are underway. In the interim, non-pharmacological therapies such as mind-body medicine, manipulative and body-based therapies and energy therapies may be used for supportive therapy.

Methods: Fifty-nine patients with breast cancer and 10 with prostate cancer enrolled in an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program that incorporated relaxation, meditation, gentle yoga, and daily home practice. Demographic and health behavior variables, quality of life, mood, stress, and the hormone measures of salivary cortisol (assessed three times/day), plasma DHEAS, and salivary melatonin were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: Fifty-eight and 42 patients were assessed pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, and sleep quality, but these improvements were not significantly correlated with the degree of program attendance or minutes of home practice. No significant improvements were seen in mood disturbance. Improvements in quality of life were associated with decreases in afternoon cortisol levels, but not with morning or evening levels. Changes in stress symptoms or mood were not related to changes in hormone levels. Approximately 40% of the sample demonstrated abnormal cortisol secretion patterns both pre- and post-intervention, but within that group patterns shifted from ""inverted-V-shaped"" patterns towards more ""V-shaped"" patterns of secretion. No overall changes in DHEAS or melatonin were found, but nonsignificant shifts in DHEAS patterns were consistent with healthier profiles for both men and women. Conclusions: MBSR program enrollment was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients, and resulted in possibly beneficial changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. These pilot data represent a preliminary investigation of the relationships between MBSR program participation and hormone levels, highlighting the need for better-controlled studies in this area. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Excessive cortisol may play a role in this increased risk. Here we explore the possibility that the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program may reduce the cortisol response to a metabolic stressor as a way of reducing disease risk in older women. Data from 16 women who were long-term practitioners of transcendental meditation (mean = 23 y) were compared with data from 14 control women matched for age (mean = 75 y, range = 65-92 y). Data on demographics, disease symptoms, and psychological variables were collected, and cortisol response to a metabolic stressor (75 g of glucose, orally) was examined in saliva and urine. Pre-glucose levels of salivary cortisol were identical for the two groups. Post-glucose cortisol rose faster in the controls and was significantly higher than that in the TM women (P &lt; 1 × 10-4). Urinary excretion of cortisol daring this period was 3 times higher in controls than in the TM women (2.4 ± 0.17 and 0.83 ± 0.10 μg/h, respectively; P = 2 × 10-4). In addition, the number of months practicing transcendental meditation was inversely correlated with CVD risk factors. Lower cortisol response to metabolic challenge may reflect improved endocrine regulation relevant to the disease-preventing effects of transcendental meditation in older women. © 2004 New York Academy of Sciences.","Cardiovascular disease; Cortisol; Meditation; Menopause; Metabolic syndrome","glucose; hydrocortisone; aged; cardiovascular disease; clinical article; clinical feature; conference paper; controlled study; correlation analysis; demography; endocrine system; female; glucose urine level; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hydrocortisone release; metabolic syndrome X; pilot study; postmenopause; psychological aspect; risk factor; saliva level; stress; transcendental meditation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14544282786

The use of complementary and alternative therapies is high among this group, but does not seem to compromise conventional treatment. It has been established that complementary therapies are used by a large proportion of the developed world, but their efficacy and safety are not always proven. This is partly due to the difficulty of studying alternative practices and the cost, but also with respect to premenstrual syndrome, problems with defining the condition and specifying end points are encountered. The difficulties in evaluating unorthodox therapies are elucidated and the evidence base for nonprescribed treatments for premenstrual syndrome is presented. Overall these women are a neglected group for whom the evidence for conventional therapy is sparse and controversial. Since the majority of women self-diagnose and self-medicate, it is important that physicians have an understanding of the variety of interventions tried and their worth.","Alternative therapies; CAM; Complementary therapy; Premenstrual syndrome","alpha tocopherol; calcium; estrogen; gestagen; progesterone; psychotropic agent; pyridoxine; serotonin uptake inhibitor; acupuncture; alternative medicine; behavior therapy; Chinese medicine; cognitive therapy; conference paper; counseling; health care system; herbal medicine; homeopathy; hormonal therapy; human; kinesiotherapy; lifestyle; manipulative medicine; massage; meditation; premenstrual dysphoric disorder; premenstrual syndrome; yoga; adult; female; hospitalization; methodology; middle aged; patient satisfaction; premenstrual syndrome; prognosis; quality of life; review; risk assessment; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; utilization review; Adult; Complementary Therapies; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Premenstrual Syndrome; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0642364488

VCRS involves a breathing pattern that is synchronized with the cardiac cycle. The signals to inhale and exhale are derived from the ECG. In this study, the subjects inspired for four heart beats and expired for four heart beats for 35 cycles. This technique is designed to have the heart beat occur at exactly the same phase in the respiratory cycle and lends itself to the study of the influence of the respiration cycle on heart rate and blood pressure changes. The heart rate and blood pressure changed simultaneously in the same direction, with the largest significant positive change occurring on the second heart beat during inspiration. The authors discuss the potential of VCRS for research, and clinical applications as a respiration modulator for hypertension therapy or increased heart rate variability.","Blood pressure; Breath control; Heart rate variability; Meditation; Respiration","Blood pressure; Clinical research; Heart; Breath control; Breathing patterns; Cardiac cycles; Heart beats; Heart rate and blood pressure; Heart rate variability; Meditation; Pressure change; Respiration; Supine position; Synchronization; adult; aged; analytic method; antihypertensive therapy; article; blood pressure; breathing pattern; electrocardiogram; exhalation; female; heart beat; heart cycle; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; inhalation; male; normal human; priority journal; supine position; voluntary cardiorespiratory synchronization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344551263

Episodic ataxia type 1 (EA-1) is characterized by brief episodes of ataxia and interictal myokymia while episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2) is manifested by longer episodes of ataxia with interictal nystagmus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows atrophy of the cerebellum, particularly the midline, with EA-2. The degree of atrophy with EA-2 is most prominent in patients with longstanding symptoms and signs. Non-specific paroxysmal slowing on electroencephalography (EEC) is reported with both EA-1 and EA-2. Continuous muscle rippling (myokymia) can be detected in patients with EA-1 and EA-2, particularly after provocation by limb ischemia. Repetitive duplets, triplets, or multiplets on EMG underlie the continuous muscle activity. At the present time, genetic testing for EA-1 and EA-2 is not available in clinical laboratories. Automated techniques are available to rapidly screen these genes for the known point mutations. Since emotional stress is often a trigger for attacks in patients with episodic ataxia syndromes, stress management techniques such as biofeedback and meditation can be helpful in controlling symptoms in some patients. Alcohol and caffeine should be avoided and regular modest exercise should be encouraged. Vigorous exercise often triggers attacks of the episodic ataxia. Fluid and food intake should be regularly distributed throughout the day and binges should be avoided. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042954442

Using hypothetico-deductive approach, it is possible to generate a neural model for explaining the 'meditative effect'. Primarily, the meditation is produced by disengaged association cortices driven by thalamus or other older group of reticular nuclei. Secondarily, there may be involvement of some more phylogenetically older structures depending upon depth and types of meditation.

Twenty-four alternative Tx were identified, ranging in scientific documentation from discrediting controlled studies through mere hypotheses to positive controlled double-blind clinical trials. Many of them are applicable only to a specific subgroup. Although oligoantigenic (few-foods) diets have convincing double-blind evidence of efficacy for a properly selected subgroup of children, they do not appear promising for adults. Enzyme-potentiated desensitization, relaxation/EMG biofeedback, and deleading also have controlled evidence of efficacy. Iron supplementation, magnesium supplementation, Chinese herbals, EEG biofeedback, massage, meditation, mirror feedback, channel-specific perceptual training, and vestibular stimulation all have promising prospective pilot data, many of these tests reasonably controlled. Single-vitamin megadosage has some intriguing pilot trial data. Zinc supplementation is hypothetically supported by systematic case-control data, but no systematic clinical trial. Laser acupuncture has promising unpublished pilot data and may be more applicable to adults than children. Essential fatty acid supplementation has promising systematic case-control data, but clinical trials are equivocal. RDA vitamin supplementation, non-Chinese herbals, homeopathic remedies, and antifungal therapy have no systematic data in ADHD. Megadose multivitamin combinations are probably ineffective for most patients and are possibly dangerous. Simple sugar restriction seems ineffective. Amino acid supplementation is mildly effective in the short term, but not beyond 2-3 months. Thyroid treatment is effective in the presence of documented thyroid abnormality. Some alternative Tx of ADHD are effective or probably effective, but mainly for certain patients. In some cases, they are the Tx of choice, and initial evaluation should consider the relevant etiologies. A few have failed to prove effective in controlled trials. Most need research to determine whether they are effective and/or to define the applicable subgroup. Some of them, although not safer than standard Tx, may be preferable for an etiologic subgroup.","ADHD; Adult; Alternative treatment; Attention deficit; Biofeedback; Diet; Herbal; Hyperactivity; Lead; Massage; Nutrition; Sensory/perceptual; Thyroid; Treatment; Yeast","amino acid; antifungal agent; antithyroid agent; essential fatty acid; iron; magnesium; vitamin; zinc; acupuncture; adult; alternative medicine; attention deficit disorder; Chinese herb; Chinese medicine; desensitization; diet therapy; drug megadose; electroencephalogram; electromyogram; feedback system; homeopathy; human; iron therapy; laser; massage; medical literature; meditation; nutrition; perception; relaxation training; review; thyroid disease; treatment indication; vestibular stimulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034952028

MRT affects the appropriate acupuncture points by the generation of high-frequency microwaves (52-78 GHz); remarkable clinical results are being achieved. In this paper, the quantum-like macroscopic biophysical bases of MRT are elaborated, offering new insights into the mechanisms of the assembling gap junction hemichannels on the internal microwave (MW) electromagnetic field spatiotemporal maxima at the temporary position of the acupuncture system, and hence insights into the biophysical nature of temporary psychosomatic health or disease. Such a picture also supports an electromagnetic/ionic ""optical"" ultra-low-frequency modulated MW quantum holographic neural network-like function of the acupuncture system (similar to complex-valued oscillatory holographic, Hopfield-like neural networks), and its essential relation to consciousness, as strongly suggested from biophysical modeling of altered states of consciousness. Finally, our electroencephalographic (EEG) investigations showed more or less characteristic EEG features in many subjects when relaxation was induced by MRT applied to corresponding acupuncture points, as well as by some other activities that may alter consciousness (transcendental meditation, musicogenic states, healer/healee noncontact interaction, drowsiness), demonstrating that EEG may permit rapid and reproducible identification of different states of consciousness, which could be useful in evaluating the effectiveness of consciousness altering techniques and related stress reduction.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347016211

Large scale surveys in the United States and abroad suggest that 35-60% of adults have used some form of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM). However, no studies to date have focused on predictors and patterns of CAM use among elderly persons. Methods. The population surveyed were Californians enrolled in a Medicare risk product that offers coverage for acupuncture and chiropractic care. Surveys were mailed to 1597 members in 1997 and responses received by 728 (51% response rate). Health risk assessment data were also obtained at baseline and 12-15 months following enrollment in the plan. Multiple logistic regression analyses were carded out to examine predictors of CAM use. Results. Forty-one percent of seniors reported use of CAM. Herbs (24%), chiropractic (20%), massage (15%), and acupuncture (14%) were the most frequently cited therapies. CAM users tended to be younger, more educated, report either arthritis and/or depression/anxiety, not be hypertensive, engage in exercise, practice meditation, and make more frequent physician visits. Use of CAM was not associated with any observed changes in health status. Respondents also expressed considerable interest in receiving third-party coverage for CAM. Although 80% reported that they had received substantial benefit from their use of CAM, the majority (58%) did not discuss the use of these therapies with their medical doctor. Conclusions. Findings suggest that there is significant interest in and use of complementary/alternative medicine among elderly persons. These results suggest the importance of further research into the use and potential efficacy of these therapies within the senior population.",,"acupuncture; adult; aged; alternative medicine; anxiety; arthritis; article; controlled study; depression; education; elderly care; exercise; female; health care utilization; health status; herbal medicine; human; hypertension; income; major clinical study; male; manipulative medicine; massage; medicare; meditation; multiple regression; physician; priority journal; race difference; risk assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0034048637

Methods: We searched 12 electronic databases and the bibliographies of the retrieved papers, review articles, and books on CAM and breast cancer. The retrieved articles were grouped by end point: breast cancer (eg, tumor size, survival), disease-related symptoms, side effects of treatment, and immune function. Within each end point, we organized the articles by modality and assessed study design, findings, and qualitative aspects. Results: Of the more than 1,000 citations retrieved, 51 fit our criteria for review. Of the articles reviewed, 17 were randomized clinical trials; three of these were trials of cancer-directed interventions, two of which involved the same treatment (melatonin). Seven articles described observational studies, and the remainder were reports of phase I or II trials. Relatively few CAM modalities reportedly used by many breast cancer patients were mentioned in articles retrieved by this process. Most articles had shortcomings. Conclusion: Although many studies had encouraging results, none showed definitively that a CAM treatment altered disease progression in patients with breast cancer. Several modalities seemed to improve other outcomes (eg, acupuncture for nausea, pressure treatments for lymphedema). If CAM studies are well-founded, well-designed, and meticulously conducted, and their hypotheses, methods, and results are reported clearly and candidly, research in this controversial area should acquire credibility both in the scientific community and among advocates of unconventional medicine.

Previous studies have linked higher religious attendance and longer survival. In this study, we examine the relationship between survival and private religious activity. Methods. A probability sample of elderly community-dwelling adults in North Carolina was assembled in 1986 and followed for 6 years. Level of participation in private religious activities such as prayer, meditation, or Bible study was assessed by self-report at baseline, along with a wide variety of sociodemographic and health variables. The main outcome was time (days) to death or censoring. Results. During a median 6.3-year follow-up period, 1,137 subjects (29.5%) died. Those reporting rarely to never participating in private religious activity had an increased relative hazard of dying over more frequent participants, but this hazard did not remain significant for the sample as a whole after adjustment for demographic and health variables. When the sample was divided into activity of daily living (ADL) impaired and unimpaired, the effect did not remain significant for the ADL impaired group after controlling for demographic variables (hazard ratio [RH] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-1.35). However, the increased hazard remained significant for the ADL unimpaired group even after controlling for demographic and health variables (RH 1.63, 95% CI 1.20-2.21), and this effect persisted despite controlling for numerous explanatory variables including health practices, social support, and other religious practices (RH 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.03). Conclusions. Older adults who participate in private religious activity before the onset of ADL impairment appear to have a survival advantage over those who do not.",,"aged; article; daily life activity; death; follow up; human; longevity; meditation; normal human; priority journal; religion; self report; social support; survival; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033922907

Meditation is known to have an effect on the mental state of practitioners. It is considered to have stress-reducing capabilities. Similarly, music is believed to make a disturbed mind calm and relieved. It is used as a therapeutic agent in some countries. In this work, the authors use music and meditation as stimuli in psychophysiological experiments using galvanic skin response (GSR) as an objective method to estimate the emotional response of subjects. Results show that GSR can be used as a measure of subjective mental states during music appreciation. The effect of music on GSR is compared with that of meditation.

The lifetime prevalence of 1% is similar in males and females and family, twin, and adoption studies provide robust evidence for a major genetic contribution to risk. There are methodological impediments to precise quantification, but the approximate lifetime risk of bipolar disorder in relatives of a bipolar proband are: monozygotic co-twin 40-70%; first degree relative 5-10%; unrelated person 0.5-1.5%. Occasional families may exist in which a single gene plays the major role in determining susceptibility, but the majority of bipolar disorder involves the interaction of multiple genes (epistasis) or more complex genetic mechanisms (such as dynamic mutation or imprinting). Molecular genetic positional and candidate gene approaches are being used for the genetic dissection of bipolar disorder. No gene has yet been identified but promising findings are emerging. Regions of interest identified in linkage studies include 4p16, 12q23-q24, 16p13, 21q22, and Xq24-q26. Chromosome 18 is also of interest but the findings are confusing with up to three possible regions implicated. To date most candidate gene studies have focused on neurotransmitter systems influenced by meditation used in clinical management of the disorder but no robust positive findings have yet emerged. It is however, almost certain that over the next few years bipolar susceptibility genes will be identified. This will have a major impact on our understanding of disease pathophysiology and will provide important opportunities to investigate the interaction between genetic and environmental factors involved in pathogenesis. This is likely to lead to major improvements in treatment and patient care but will also raise important ethical issues that will need to be addressed.","Bipolar disorder; Manic depressive illness","adoption; chromosome 12q; chromosome 16p; chromosome 18; chromosome 21q; chromosome 4p; chromosome Xq; environmental factor; female; gene function; gene mutation; genetic disorder; genetic epistasis; genetic linkage; genetic susceptibility; heredity; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; manic depressive psychosis; molecular genetics; monozygotic twins; mood; priority journal; review; X chromosome linkage",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032803524

Oxytocin may, however, also be released by nonnoxious stimuli such as touch, warm temperature etc. in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, oxytocin may be involved in physiological and behavioral effects induced by social interaction in a more general context. In both male and female rats oxytocin exerts potent physiological antistress effects. If daily oxytocin injections are repeated over a 5-day period, blood pressure is decreased by 10-20 mmHg, the withdrawal latency to heat stimuli is prolonged, cortisol levels are decreased and insulin and cholecystokinin levels are increased. These effects last from 1 to several weeks after the last injection. After repeated oxytocin treatment weight gain may be promoted and the healing rate of wounds increased. Most behavioral and physiological effects induced by oxytocin can be blocked by oxytocin antagonists. In contrast, the antistress effects can not, suggesting that unidentified oxytocin receptors may exist. The prolonged latency in the tail- flick test can be temporarily reversed by administration of naloxone, suggesting that endogenous opioid activity has been increased by the oxytocin injections. In contrast, the long-term lowering of blood pressure and of cortisol levels as well as the sedative effects of oxytocin have been found to be related to an increased activity of central α2-adrenoceptors. Positive social interactions have been related to health-promoting effects. Oxytocin released in response to social stimuli may be part of a neuroendocrine substrate which underlies the benefits of positive social experiences. Such processes may in addition explain the health-promoting effects of certain alternative therapies. Because of the special properties of oxytocin, including the fact that it can become conditioned to psychological state or imagery, oxytocin may also mediate the benefits attributed to therapies such as hypnosis or meditation.","Growth; Healing; Oxytocin; Somatosensory stimuli; Stress","oxytocin; animal experiment; behavior; breast feeding; conference paper; controlled study; emotion; female; hypnosis; imagery; male; nonhuman; oxytocin release; priority journal; rat; social interaction; somatosensory stimulation; stress; weight gain; wound healing; Animals; Breast Feeding; Emotions; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Lactation; Male; Neurosecretory Systems; Object Attachment; Oxytocin; Parents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345059241

Colavito, the 'biocultural paradigm.' This paradigm shows that biology and culture act on one another as the conditioning parameters of neurocultural information. Through mutual interaction biology in humans becomes culture, and vice versa, culture opens and stimulates the neural passages of the brains, accounting thus for the varieties of brains in humans, and for cultural diversity. Culture conditions and stimulates biology, while biology conditions and makes culture possible. Cultures and brains may be distinguished from one another through identification with certain functions or combination of functions that are exercised habitually, or become neural hard-wire through repetition or habit. This new model has replaced older and simpler models of the nature/nurture controversy, such as the unextended rational substance of Descartes, the tabula rasa of Locke, the associated-matrix of Hume, the passive, reinforcement-driven animal of Skinner, and the genetically hard-wired robot of the sociobiologists. However, elements of these earlier models are included in the new one, but the conversation about human experience has changed, and, therefore the human images of ourselves. This change was forced on scientists by the importance of the conditionality of the experience of 'I' and 'not-I' as described by Alex Comfort in his book I and That, and was introduced in the conversations some of us already had with each other. This article focuses on the 'I' and 'not-I' experiences with a description of the 'not-I' or 'oceanic' or 'mystical' experience to clarify the new paradigm of 'biocultures'.","Biocultures; Epistemology; Human development; Imagination; Inner technologies; Meditation; Mystics","brain; brain development; conversation; cultural anthropology; experience; human; mysticism; neurochemistry; priority journal; review; science; Animalia; Rasa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031975284

These guidelines are intended to provide a common basis for planning, evaluating and interpreting clinical studies and facilitating development of new and effective drugs for the treatment of dependence. For each class of abusable substances, certain clinical situations stand out as targets for intervention, while others may seem less relevant. The focus of clinical research needs to be tailored to the clinically relevant situations for each drug of abuse. In general, the pharmacotherapies being considered for treatment of abuse and dependence disorders are used to achieve one or more of six major objectives: 1. Reduction in the risk of addiction; 2. Reduction in high-risk behavior; 3. Reduction in morbidity and mortality from addiction; 4. Reduction in drug use and/or induction of abstinence; 5. Relief of symptoms of withdrawal; and 6. Relapse prevention; along with rehabilitation and restoration of functioning. General requirements for outcome measures include measuring drug use, abstinence, withdrawal, and relapse. For all outcomes, both the validity and the meaningfulness must be established. Although considerable neurobiological knowledge relative to cocaine has been acquired, investigation of applicable medications based on these data is still under development. Many studies to date have focused on modifying dopamine function. Because dopamine plays a critical biologic role in motivation, reward and locomotion, modification of its activity may potentially contribute to serious adverse effects. An optimal strategy might require the use of several medications that have different mechanisms of action, or several meditations targeted at different aspects of the problem (e.g., relapse craving, etc.). The agonist approach is believed to be potentially problematic because of effects on cardiovascular function and temperature regulation. A substitution model (comparable to methadone for heroin dependence) has not been proposed. The antagonist model is hampered by the fact that reinforcing effects are mediated through dopamine, which, if blocked, might produce a sufficient anhedonic state that compliance with the treatment regimen might be unlikely. Unlike opiates and alcohol, the withdrawal syndrome from cocaine and other stimulants is subtle and usually is not seen as requiring medication intervention.",,"1 [2 (benzhydryloxy)ethyl] 4 (3 phenylpropyl)piperazine; 2 dipropylamino 7 hydroxytetralin; 3,4 dichloro n methyl n [2 (1 pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide; 3beta (4 fluorophenyl) 2beta tropanecarboxylic acid methyl ester; 4 (3 butoxy 4 methoxybenzyl) 2 imidazolidinone; 8 chloro 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 3 methyl 5 phenyl 1h 3 benzazepin 7 ol hydrogen maleate; alcohol; cocaine; diamorphine; dopamine; flupentixol; methadone; methylphenidate; nicotine gum; olanzapine; opiate; quinpirole; tropane derivative; vanoxerine; abstinence; cardiovascular function; clinical trial; conference paper; drug dependence; drug research; drug synthesis; heroin dependence; high risk population; human; locomotion; meta analysis; morbidity; mortality; motivation; neurobiology; nonhuman; oral drug administration; reinforcement; relapse; reward; smoking cessation; symptom; thermoregulation; withdrawal syndrome",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031872046

Previous studies of the Transcendental Meditation' (TM) technique as a possible means of countering effects of stress have reported altered levels of several hormones both during the practice and longitudinally after regular pratice of this technique. In this prospective, random assignment study, changes in baseline levels and acute responses to laboratory stressors were examined for four hormones-cortisol, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone and testosterone-before and after 4 months of either the TM technique or a stress education control condition. At pre- and post-test, blood was withdrawn continuously through an indwelling catheter, and plasma or serum samples were frozen for later analysis by radioimmunoassay. The results showed significantly different changes for the two groups, or trends toward significance, for each hormone over the 4 months. In the TM group, but not in the controls, basal cortisol level and average cortisol across the stress session decreased from pre- to post-test. Cortisol responsiveness to stressors, however, increased in the TM group compared to controls. The baselines and/or stress responsiveness for TSH and GH changed in opposite directions for the groups, as did the testosterone baseline. Overall, the cortisol and testosterone results appear to support previous data suggesting that repeated practice of the TM technique reverses effects of chronic stress significant for health. The observed group difference in the change of GH regulation may derive from the cortisol differences, while the TSH results are not related easily to earlier findings on the effects of chronic stress.","Aging; Cortisol; Health; Meditation; Prevention; Stress","growth hormone; hydrocortisone; testosterone; thyrotropin; adaptation; adult; aging; article; clinical trial; growth hormone blood level; human; hydrocortisone blood level; male; neuroendocrine system; normal human; priority journal; stress; testosterone blood level; thyrotropin blood level; transcendental meditation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Arousal; Follow-Up Studies; Health Education; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Male; Meditation; Prospective Studies; Reference Values; Stress, Psychological; Testosterone; Thyrotropin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030837540

The data has been analyzed using structural analysis to measure the altered state of consciousness and the identity state by comparing mediative state with non-meditative state. The structural analysis of pattern of consciousness during the meditative state revealed altered experience in perception (percentile rank PR = 90), meaning (PR = 82) and time sense (PR = 87), while positive affect dimension showed increased joy (PR = 73) and love (PR = 67). The imagery vividness (PR = 72), self-awareness (PR = 77), rationality (PR = 73) and arousal (PR = 69) were found to be structurally different from the ordinary state. With regards to identity state meditative experience was found to produce statistically significant changes in terms of intensity in meaning (P < 0.05), time sense (P < 0.05), joy (P < 0.05), love (P < 0. 05) and state of awareness (P < 0.01).

In this organisation, the documentation plays a major role for the planning and coordination of work procedures and information flow within the medical staff. Various studies in intensive care units (ICU) reveal that the complex work organisation and the related information flow are faulty. Breakdowns are often caused by a lack of coordination between doctors and nurses end by poor transparency of work procedures. A typical example is the incorrect application of a doctor's medication orders by a nurse because she might have overseen a plan modification. This intransparency increases the strain on the medical staff and might result in critical effects on the patient. One approach to design a computer support for medication planning as well as the coordination when executing meditation plans is given by work flow models. This paper shows that work flow models could be used to improve deficiencies in meditation planning and coordination. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how such a support can be mediated to the user through an appropriately designed user interface.","Computer supported cooperative work; Information system; Medication support; System ergonomics; User interface design","article; computer interface; computer system; coordination; drug therapy; health care planning; intensive care unit; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030756406

It may also be time to re-consider the similar use of electro- convulsive therapy (ECT), if indeed it is still being used in this context. This is the first known recent study to determine the frequency of ECT among incompetent defendants. Records from the two forensic psychiatric facilities in New York State that receive over 95% of all indicted felony offenders who are incompetent to stand trial were retrospectively reviewed for a five year study period. All requests to the court for authorization for involuntary treatment with ECT were sought. In the study period, out of approximately 1365 total persons committed, them was one case of a request to the court to administer involuntary ECT to an incompetent defendant. This request was granted after a Rivers hearing. This single case, in which involuntary ECT was not effective, is described. This study serves to demonstrate that involuntary ECT is still requested and administered in New York State to incompetent defendants. In light of the concerns raised in Riggins about involuntary meditation, it seems reasonable and necessary to re-consider whether and under what conditions ECT should be involuntarily administered to a pre-trial defendant.

One theory of the relationship between stress and disease is based on the concept of homeostasis, a term coined by Cannon over 50 years ago to signify those states and mechanisms responsible for the 'staying power of the body'. Bernard, Cannon, Selye and other leading researchers held that full, normal function of the self-regulating or homeostatic power of the body maintains the balanced, integrated condition we recognize as health. Failures in this capacity, such as those produced by frequent stressful experiences, can result in disease or death. Theories of health and disease surprisingly similar to this have existed since ancient times, and in widely different cultures. This review discusses both the fundamental elements of these theories and the current neuroendocrine research supporting their validity and immediate relevance. The connections between ancient and modern knowledge described herein were made possible largely by the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a scholar and teacher of the ancient vedic tradition of India. A key part of Ayurveda that has been obscure to modern science is the substance 'ojas', which the classical texts say maintains balance of the physiology. In this article, specific steroids or steroid classes are proposed as likely candidates for both the 'ordinary' and the 'superior' types of ojas described in Ayurveda. Current evidence for the functions of these steroids, as well as their role in stress, disease and the maintenance of health, is reviewed. The knowledge of Ayurverda, as recently brought to light by Maharishi, includes methods for recovering and maintaining optimal function of steroidal systems. Such effects may help mediate the improvements in health and increased longevity attributed to Ayurveda and other ancient methods.","aging; cholesterol; homeostasis; hypothalamus; preventi on; resistance; steroids","ayurvedic drug; cholesterol; steroid; aging; health; herbal medicine; history of medicine; homeostasis; human; india; meditation; neuroendocrine system; pharmacology; physiology; prevention; review; stress; traditional medicine; Aging; Cholesterol; Homeostasis; Human; India; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Mental Health; Neurosecretory Systems; Preventive Medicine; Steroids; Stress; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028814290

Four patients with insulin‐dependent diabetes reduced or stopped their insulin in favour of therapeutic approaches including prayer, faith healing, unusual diets, and supplements of vitamins and trace elements. This resulted in ketoacidosis in three, in one case life‐threatening; and weight loss and hyperglycaemia in the other. One patient developed serious retinopathy. Additionally, eight other types of alternative diabetic treatment are described, not as far as we know associated with such serious complications. These include homeopathy, reflexology, meditation, herbal treatment, ‘cellular nutrition’, ‘subconscious healing’, ‘pearl therapy’ (drinking milk in which pearls have been boiled) and ‘astrotherapy’ (tying pieces of coral around the arm). Diabetes is a chronic incurable disease, for which modern treatments remain somewhat unsatisfactory. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that some patients seek alternative treatments with more attractive claims. Diabetes health professionals need to be aware of the potential dangers associated with some of these treatments. 1994 Diabetes UK","Alternative medicine; Diabetes; Ketoacidosis","adult; alternative medicine; article; clinical article; diabetes mellitus; female; human; ketoacidosis; male; Adult; Case Report; Complementary Therapies; Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent; Female; Homeopathy; Human; Male; Massage; Phytotherapy; Relaxation Techniques; Religion and Medicine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0028280140

There was considerable inter-subject variability in the different components.

These results suggest that the inter-subject variability of middle latency auditory evoked potentials precludes using them as the method of choice for assessing the effects of meditation.

It has been claimed that Indian yogis can voluntarily become hypometabolic (bhoogarbha samadhi) in a sealed underground chamber as a means of remaining in a mediative state for multiday periods. 2. 2. To investigate this claim we obtained cooperation of a practitioner of bhoogarbha samadhi. In an open flow system, we measured his resting rate of oxygen consumption and also his oxygen consumption rate over a 5 h period during which he was requested to display his abilities to become hypometabolic as if he were in bhoogarbha samadhi. 3. 3. The yogi's resting O2 consumption was 3.06 ml O2kg-1 min1 and his O2 consumption over a 4h period of meditation was 1.85±0.26 ml O2kg-1min-1, a reduction of 40%. 4. 4. At the beginning of the mediation there was a peripheral vasodilation and a fall in core body temperature of 0.4°C. These events were reversed at the end of the meditation period. 5. 5.

In the 1970s there was a surge of interest in psychological treatment of cardiovascular diseases as either an adjunct to standard pharmacological or surgical treatment or even as an alternative to them. There have been two main approaches to psychological control of blood pressure. The first uses the relatively new method of technical biofeedback control of physiologic processes. The second class of approaches relies on a mixed bag of ancient and modern methods which have in common the elicitation of some form of the relaxation response, including progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, hypnosis and yoga.",,"adult; cardiovascular system; feedback system; human; hypertension; hypnosis; leisure; meditation; muscle; muscle relaxation; priority journal; psychological aspect; short survey; therapy; yoga; article; electromyography; hypertension; physiology; psychophysiology; Biofeedback (Psychology); Electromyography; Human; Hypertension; Relaxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022202242

The present paper discusses the effects of oscillatory magnetic fields in the extremely low frequency range on electrophysiological and biochemical parameters in human subjects. Normal subjects and practitioners of Yoga and meditation were exposed to sinusoidally oscillating magnetic fields in the frequency range of 0.01 to 10 Hz and with amplitudes of ±5 and ±50 nT generated inside a special controlled magnetic field enclosure with the subjects' heads oriented in the four cardinal directions and also in sitting posture, and against ambient magnetic fields of about 40000 nT (local geomagnetic field) and half this value (or 20000 nT). The ECG, finger blood flow and respiration were recorded continuously on a polygraph. The EEG was also recorded on an 8-channel machine with split-up of waves into alpha, beta, delta and theta components. Biochemical assays were carried out on the blood and urine. Certain decisive changes were observed in the electrophysiology, such as, for instance, a sharp inhibition of the brain's electrical activity with the head towards the North and, in contrast, an accentuation of activity in the East orientation. Alterations in the levels of metabolites of catechol and indole amines were seen in the North orientation. © 1985.",,"MAGNETIC FIELDS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; METABOLITE LEVELS; OSCILLATORY MAGNETIC FIELDS; HUMAN ENGINEERING",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022157519

Hence, forearm oxygen consumption decline was due almost solely to decreased rate of oxygen extraction. Small variation of forearm blood flow implies that little of the previous findings of increased nonrenal, nonhepatic circulation during TM or increased nonrenal circulation during ordinary rest can be accounted for by altered muscle blood flow, which therefore is consistent with possible increased cerebral blood flow.

For study of the physiology of behavior at this level, the erythrocyte may be useful, because it is readily available and its metabolism and metabolic control are comparatively well understood. In this report we describe a marked decline of red cell glycolytic rate induced by the transcendental meditation technique (TM). This decline was significantly corrrelated with decreased plasma lactate concentration and with relaxation as indicated by electrodermal response. The occurrence of sleep was not correlated with the metabolic changes. The observed lack of variation of blood pH, blood gases, and hematocrit in this behavior implies that the decrease of erythrocyte metabolism is not an epiphenomenon of respiratory change or substrate availability. Based upon further measurements indicating persisting alteration of the red blood cell, we suggest the possibility of attachment of a humoral agent(s) to the cell in the mechanism of this effect.

Ten tests, viz., cancellation of number 9, digit span, alphabet, nonsense syllables, paired association of words, coding, reproduction of geometric figures, recognition of geometric figures, arithmetic and Raven's standard progressive matrices were selected because of their simplicity in administration and objectivity in measuring the performance. The subjects were boys aged 12-18 yr selected from a Correctional School and matched for age group, education and nature of commitment to the Correctional School. Twenty three boys who practised TM for 6 months showed improvement over the control group (15 in number) in a number of tests. However, the improvement was statistically significant only in case of the coding, time factor, and on Raven's standard progressive matrices. With the arithmetic test, the improvement of the experimental group over the control group fell just short of being significant.

During a series of visual stimuli occuring at fixed intervals, with 10 % random omissions, the subjects were asked : 1) to respond by a finger displacement to each visual stimulus ; 2) to hold on the response to the stimulus and to respond to omission. Both tasks were recorded before and after the practice of meditation or rest for the controls. The intergroup comparison showed that the experimental subjects had faster RT's with less mistakes, and N120 and P200 of larger amplitude and shorter latency. These differencies were significant before and after meditation. The transient effects of meditation or rest, were opposite for the two groups : whereas after meditation the RT's became longer with less mistakes, and the amplitude of P300 larger, after rest there was a decrease of the P300 amplitude and no change in the RT's of the controls.

In order to corroborate these problems, this study was undertaken on 262 cases of psychosomatic diseases in the field of internal medicine. It is a complete fasting for 10 days with nothing by mouth except for drinking water, and 500 ml of parenteral fluid containing vitamins are administered intravenously every day. Absolute bed rest and self meditation are required in a closed individual room, and patients are not allowed to meet anyone but physician and nurse in charge. The return to normal ordinary diet follows the order of fluid diet, soft diet and semiordinary diet during 5 days. In the period of the therapy, various clinical and laboratory examinations were carried out. Significance of these examinations consists in prediction of possible danger during the fasting period and elucidation of its therapeutic mechanism. Consequently, an outstanding efficacy rate of 87% with excellent prognosis was attained, and the following diseases were determined as suitable indication of this therapy; irritable colon, dysorexia nervosa, borderline hypertension, neuro circulatory asthenia, bronchial asthma, mild diabetes mellitus, obesity, lumbago without organic findings, conversion hysteria, various neurosis with somatic symptoms and masked depression. Possible mechanism of action of the therapy is that fasting acts as an extreme stress on the function of the autonomic nervous and endocrine systems, then it regulates the function of whole body including the brain, also it acts as one of the behaviour therapy for abnormal conditioning. © 1976, Tohoku University Medical Press.
